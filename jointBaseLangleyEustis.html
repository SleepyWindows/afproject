                <h2 class="header">Privatized Housing</h2>
                <p id="getting-started-statement">At Fort Eustis, military family housing is privatized. Balfour Beatty Communities owns the family housing and is responsible for managing, building, and maintaining the community. In addition to your option to purchase and rent housing in the local community, you now may choose to live in privatized housing by signing a Tenant Lease Agreement with Balfour Beatty Communities.<br><br>For comprehensive information about the privatized housing community at Fort Eustis, visit the Balfour Beatty Communities website. The website provides information you need to know about the homes and amenities available in the privatized housing community as well as the application process.</p>
                <h3>Community Amenities</h3>
                <p>Privatized housing is comparable to housing in the local community and provides a wide variety of amenities and support services designed specifically to meet military family needs such as our . LifeWorks at Balfour Beatty CommunitiesÂ® BC program where residents will find a variety of activities, seminars and events available for every member of the family. Living on post can save time with no wait at the gate and save on gas by living so close.<br><br>Community features include a community center facility that contains a fitness center, multi-purpose room, television, and computer center, with playgrounds,tot lots located in various neighborhoods, a spray park and basketball and volleyball courts, are just some of the amenities you will find at Balfour Beatty Communities.<br><br> As a resident of privatized housing, contact the Community Management Office to obtain specific information on the services available at your location.</p>
                <h3>Paying Rent for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Similar to living in the local community, you will sign a Tenant Lease Agreement, typically for a one-year term. Your lease includes a military clause and a lease termination clause. You pay your monthly rent by authorizing an allotment of your BAH that is paid directly to the Community Manager. If your move occurs prior to the allotment start date, then you will need to pay the pro-rated rent directly to the Community Manager. The Tenant Lease Agreement defines all relevant rent payment terms and conditions.<br><br>Military families are not required to pay an application fee, pet or security deposit and have access to 24/7 maintenance personnel as well as receive landscaping and trash collection services at no additional charge.</p>
                <h3>Gas and Electric Utilities</h3>
                <p>At this location, homes in the community are individually metered and you will be billed directly for electricity. Minol USA manages and collects your utility bill based on personal consumption. Since the homes are metered, a portion of your BAH is allotted to pay the utilities directly. The utility allowance is determined based on 110 percent with a 15% buffer of the estimated average utility cost (gas and electric) for each unit type. The more energy you conserve, the more money you keep in your pocket! For more information about your utilities, please contact the Community Management Office.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>Balfour Beatty Communities provides $20,000 property insurance with each lease signed.</p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>
                <p>Elementary school is on post; Middle and high School are off post.</p>
