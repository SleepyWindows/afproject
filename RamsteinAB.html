                <h2 class="header">Privatized Housing</h2>
                <p id="getting-started-statement">For many families, living in government housing provides easy access to a wealth of community services and amenities such as schools, youth programs, Commissary/Exchange, and food services. This is especially true in overseas locations where you will find yourself dependent on the support facilities and services on the installation much more than those in the U.S. Living within government housing provides a safe and secure place to reside and provides a mentoring and supportive environment for families.<br><br>Government housing is provided to military members who meet the appropriate criteria. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Members with command sponsored dependents authorized to reside with them</li>
                    <li>Military-Married-to-Military couples assigned to same or adjacent base and reside jointly</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Contact the Military Housing Office (MHO) if you have any questions about the housing eligibility criteria at this location.</p>
                <p>KMC Housing<br><br>We offer government housing in 3 different locations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ramstein</li>
                    <li>Vogelweh</li>
                    <li>Landstuhl</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our inventory consists of 3 and 4 story multi-unit stairwell buildings and townhouses. All units have 110 and 220 volt electrical outlets, built-in dishwasher, mini-blinds or rolladens and ceiling fans.<br><br>Townhouses have small private yards and an attached garage. You will be responsible for yard maintenance and snow removal whether you decide to live on or off base. Cable television is available at occupant expense (no satellite dishes or external antennas are authorized in base housing).<br><br>Waterbeds and outside storage sheds are not permitted. Privately owned outside recreation equipment may be installed inside the back yards of townhouses with prior approval of the Housing Office. Schools and playgrounds are located throughout the housing areas.</p>
                <h3>Applying for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Applications can be submitted no more than 30 days prior to arrival after completing the virtual housing briefing. As long as you apply for government housing within 30 days of your arrival, you will be placed on the waiting list effective the date you departed from your previous installation. After 30 days, the application date will be the date of the walk-in.

                    <br><br>Please be sure your application identifies and includes supporting documentation for an impending promotion or gain of dependents so that you can be placed on the appropriate waiting list.
                    
                    <br><br>Storage is not available at Ramstein AB. Members are encouraged to take advantage of the non-temporary storage option prior to PCS, since government housing, off-base housing and apartments may be smaller than stateside homes. Excess property shipped that will not fit or is too large for your house at Ramstein will not be stored nor will be shipped at government expense.</p>
                <h3>Wait List for Housing</h3>
                <p>Average waiting times for government housing vary depending on your housing category and number of bedrooms authorized. You will be offered housing based on availability.  The MHO will help you find a home in the local community and provide you with information on housing allowance authorizations until government housing becomes available.  See Featured Documents to view wait times at KMC.</p>
                <h3>Community Amenities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lighted walking/jogging trails with exercise stations</li>
                    <li>Dog Parks located at Ramstein and Vogelweh</li>
                    <li>Basketball Courts</li>

                <p>Please see Installation pet policy.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle.<br><br>There are several types of insurance (personal property, liability, pet insurance and legal representation) members may purchase to protect their property and tenant rights. We strongly recommend you consider buying commercial insurance to protect yourself in case of fire or a major loss. A common policy for this coverage would likely be a renter's liability insurance, which would cover your personal property and damages to your rental. "The Find-It Guide", under Featured Links, lists several companies you may want to contact. Be smart and plan ahead!<br><br>Before purchasing your insurance, please consult the MHO for more information about coverage.</p>
                <h3>Furnishing Management </h3>

                <h3>Housing Services</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving. The government housing team will provide you the latest information on the local housing situation as well as local laws governing off-base housing. The MHO partners with landlords, realtors and property managers to make sure you receive the most current information about the local housing market. Please be advised, In accordance with DOD policy, the Ramstein AB Housing Office no longer validates rental rates.<br><br>The MHO monitors off-base rental listings to ensure that they are safe and adequate.<br><br>The MHO can assist you by:</p>

                    <li>Providing translation services to establish appointments to view available units</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Sponsors are relied upon to provide transportation to assist members in their house hunting quest. The MHO also has a placement team that can assist in locating housing and providing transportation during normal duty hours. However this service is by appointment so please contact the MHO for further information.

                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle.<br><br>There are several types of insurance (personal property, liability, pet insurance and legal representation) members may purchase to protect their property and tenant rights.<br><br>We strongly recommend you consider buying commercial insurance to protect yourself in case of fire or a major loss.

                <h3>Realtor Services</h3>
                <p>The use of local realtor services is typically unnecessary and is not recommended unless a home for rent is only listed with a specific realtor. In OCONUS, if you choose to use realtor services, discuss fees up front, as some realtors charge a finder's fee and government reimbursement is rarely authorized. To request government reimbursement for realtor services in OCONUS, you must submit a request for authorization through the MHO before signing a lease or contract. In CONUS, fees for realtor services are not reimbursable.</p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>
                <p>For families, we understand that where your children attend school plays a large factor in the decision of where to live.<br><br>For more information about schools, visit the Kaiserslautern District Superintendent's Office website.</p>
