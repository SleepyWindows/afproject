In addition to your option to purchase and rent housing in the local community, you now may choose to live in privatized housing by signing a tenant lease agreement with Mayroad.

                    <br><br>For comprehensive information about the privatized housing community at McConnell, visit the Mayroad website. The website provides information you need to know about the homes, amenities and services available in the privatized housing community.</p>
