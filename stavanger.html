                <h2 class="header">Community Housing</h2>
                <h3>Housing in the Local Community</h3>
                <p id="faq-information">The Military Housing Office (MHO) provides all DoD personnel with a personalized service to assist in locating suitable housing in your new host country. Moving to a new country can often be confusing and stressful; however, it can also be exciting. Living off base provides members and families the chance to experience a new culture and make friends with their host country neighbors. The MHO will assist you every step of the way to help you find your new home in the local community.</p>
                <h3>Housing Services</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving. The government housing team will provide you the latest information on the local housing situation as well as local laws governing off-base housing. The MHO partners with landlords, realtors and property managers to make sure you receive the most current information about the local housing market. The MHO monitors off-base rental listings to ensure that they are safe and adequate. The MHO can assist you by: - Providing translation services to establish appointments to view available units - Assisting in establishing utility services - Providing furnishings support. See Furnishings Management for a list of the Duration of Tour Items available. The housing office does not provide transportation, ask your sponsor for assistance. After you move into your home, the MHO is available for on-going assistance with translation services should you need to communicate with your landlord.</p>
                <h3>Community Housing Units</h3>
                <p>The MHO provides referral to local realtors/landlords for the most current listing of available economy units, translation services, and landlord/tenant mediation.</p>
                <h3>Housing Allowances</h3>
                <p>For information about housing allowances that financially support your move, see Referral and Relocation Assistance, or go to Overseas Housing Allowance | OHA Rate Lookup | Defense Travel Management Office (dod.mil)  LOCATIONS:  Norway - Stavanger (INCL SOLA AS) -NO021 OR, LOCALITY CODE: NO021</p>
                <h3>Oversized Furniture</h3>
                <p>Due to the size of Norwegian homes we do not recommend shipping oversized furniture. Many bedrooms are small, have a sloped roof and narrow staircase leading to the second floor. </p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle.</p>
                <h3>Realtor Services</h3>
                <p>Local realtor services will provide information for properties they have in their portfolio and set-up appointments with landlords.  Realtors in general don't charge a showing fee, landlords pay realtors first month's rent to list properties.  MHO will send the realtor information sheet (can be found under Featured Documents, Stavanger Housing Brochure) to contact realtors about 30 days prior to your arrival.</p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>
                <p>For families, we understand that where your children attend school plays a large factor in the decision of where to live. For more information about schools, visit the 426th Air Base Squadron School Liaison website or contact the School Liaison at 426abs.cca@stavanger.af.mil</p>
