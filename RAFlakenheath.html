                <p>You will receive an Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) while stationed overseas, if you do not reside in Military Family Housing, OHA is adjusted to the dollar's value against the pound. Rent caps are established by rank. A member will either receive OHA in the amount equal to their rent rate or the rate cap, whichever is the least. You will also receive a monthly utility allowance that will help pay your utility costs. You may also receive a Move-In Housing Allowance if you do not reside in Military Family Housing. This is a one-time allowance that is received when first renting a house on the economy to defray the setup cost of moving into a house to include transformers, curtains or any other items needed to furnish your house.<br><br>Information on rates and allowances <br>http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/</p>
                <h3>TLA Procedures</h3>
                <p>Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA) is an entitlement to help defray the cost of lodging while seeking permanent housing. TLA is closely monitored and certain criteria must be met to continue to receive TLA. Members will be briefed on their TLA entitlement and their responsibilities at their Newcomer’s Briefing. It is extremely important to attend this briefing immediately upon arrival. TLA is authorized for payment while member is "aggressively seeking housing."<br><br>Lodging should be reserved as far in advance of your arrival as possible and should be secured for a full  30 days. Please coordinate with Liberty Lodge on RAF Lakenheath or Gateway Inns on RAF Mildenhall for your lodging needs.  After the initial 30 day stay, you will become space-available and may need to secure other lodging.<br><br>Upon arrival and after attendance at the MFRC Newcomer's Briefing an Assistance Counsellor will be assigned to all newcomers, they will be your Housing POC to assist with any TLA or OHA questions and reimbursements that you may have.</p>
