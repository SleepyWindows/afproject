Some amenities may include community centers, playgrounds and walking trails.<br><br>All residents in government housing will have the option of signing a lease with the private company. Rent under privatized housing is paid by allotment of your Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). Unlike housing in the local community, rent for a privatized home may not exceed the "with dependent" BAH rate designated for your rank.<br><br>For more information about privatized housing, contact the MHO at DSN: 330-3688</p>
