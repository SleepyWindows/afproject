                <h2 class="header">Privatized Housing</h2>
                <p id="getting-started-statement">At Robins Air Force Base, military family housing is privatized. Hunt Military Communities owns the family housing and is responsible for maintaining, repairing, constructing and managing the community. In addition to your option to purchase and rent housing in the local community, you now may choose to live in privatized housing by signing a tenant lease agreement with Hunt Military Communities.<br><br>For comprehensive information about the privatized housing community at Robins Air Force Base visit the Hunt Military Communities website. The website provides information you need to know about the homes and amenities available in the privatized housing community.</p>
                <h3>Applying for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving to Robins Air Force Base. The government housing team will provide you the latest information about privatized housing and details about the application process. The MHO will also update you on any base specific policies regarding residing in privatized housing.</p>
                <h3>Community Amenities</h3>
                <p>Privatized housing is comparable to housing in the local community and provides a wide variety of amenities and support services.<br><br>Community features such as community center, playgrounds, walking trails, and pools are just some of the amenities you will find at Robins Hunt Military Communities.<br><br>As a resident of privatized housing, contact the Property Management Office to obtain more specific information on the services available at your location.</p>
                <h3>Paying Rent for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Similar to living in the local community, you will sign a tenant lease agreement, typically for a one-year term. Your lease includes a military clause and a lease termination clause. You pay your monthly rent by authorizing an allotment of your BAH that is paid directly to the Property Manager. If your move occurs prior to the allotment start date, then you will need to pay the pro-rated rent directly to the Property Manager. The Tenant Lease Agreement spells out all relevant rent payment terms and conditions.</p>
                <h3>Gas and Electric Utilities</h3>
                <p>At Robins Phase I located one mile from base, homes in the community are metered and you will be billed directly for gas and electric. Georgia Power and the City of Warner Robins manages and collects your electric and gas bill respectively based on personal consumption. Since the homes are metered, you will retain a portion of the BAH to pay the utilities directly.<br><br>The utility allowance is determined based on the estimated average utility cost (gas and electric) for each unit type.<br><br>At Robins Phase II located on base, homes in the community are metered and your rent will include a utility allowance within your full BAH amount.<br><br>The more energy you conserve, the more money you keep in your pocket!<br><br>For more information about your utilities, please contact the Property Management Office.<br><br>Utility Allowance Policy Q&A Information can be found under the Important Links section of this page.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle.<br><br>Before purchasing your insurance, please consult the Property Management Office for more information about coverage.</p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>
                <p>For families, we understand that where your children attend school plays a large factor in the decision of where to live.<br><br>Visit the Houston County Board of Education website for information on public schools.</p>

                <h2 class="header">Unaccompanied Housing</h2>
                <p id="heat-statement">At Robins Air Force Base we strive to create an inclusive environment that cultivates the development and training of Airmen. The Air Force recognizes that the management of Unaccompanied Housing (UH) facilities is critical to an Airman's development process. UH is a personal residence and we strive to provide a modern, functional, well maintained and comfortable home, as well as promote pride, professionalism and personal dignity.<br><br>UH is provided for unaccompanied Airmen in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service. Each Airman is provided a private sleeping room, furnishings, bed linens and supplies required for comfortable living. (Room arrangements may vary depending on location)<br><br>Unaccompanied Airmen in the rank of E-4 with greater than 3 years of service and above will move into housing in the local community. Please refer to the Housing in the Local Community section for information and assistance on securing housing.<br><br>The permanent party UH campus at Robins Air Force Base consists of private rooms with shared bathrooms.</p>
                <h3>Amenities</h3>
                <p>Amenities include plentiful parking, walking/bike trail, grills and picnic tables lighted basketball court and sand volleyball. The Dining Facility is conveniently located in the center of the campus</p>
                <h3>Base Specific Policy</h3>
                <p>During your orientation, the ADL or UH Management Office representative will inform you of all Air Force and base-specific policies.</p>
                <h3>UH Management Office Staff</h3>
                <p>The UH Management Office is staffed with professionals that can assist with all of your housing needs. Staffs vary but can be comprised of non-commissioned officers (NCO), Senior NCOs and some bases have civilian employees. The assigned military are Airman Dormitory Leaders (ADL). These members are highly motivated personnel dedicated to ensuring that residents receive quality service. ADLs will provide you guidance and advice on UH life as well as mentor you on succeeding in the Air Force.</p>
                <h3>Assignment Procedures</h3>
                <p>As soon as you are notified of your assignment, contact your gaining unit and request to be assigned a sponsor. Your sponsor will be another military member assigned to your unit and will assist with your move. The sponsor or gaining unit must then contact the UH Management Office to notify them of your impending arrival date and work to secure you a dormitory room.</p>
                <h3>Unit Integrity</h3>
                <p>In most cases, you will be assigned a room in an area of the dormitory set aside for the personnel who work in your unit. This is to promote camaraderie among squadron members. If a room is not available near other members of your unit, you may be assigned a temporary room until one with your unit becomes available.</p>
                <h3>Planning Your Move</h3>
                <p>Prior to travel, arrange to meet your sponsor or someone from your unit upon arrival at the gaining installation.<br><br>If you arrive on a business day during normal duty hours, have your sponsor escort you to the UH Management Office. An ADL or a civilian Dorm Manager will take you through the process of checking you into your room and performing a move-in inspection and inventory of the allotted furnishings and supplies.<br><br>If you arrive on the weekend or after normal duty hours, have your sponsor make arrangements to pick up your room key from the UH Management Office or acquire a hospitality room for you until you can meet with an ADL or Dorm Manager. If you obtain your room key outside of normal duty hours, it is still a mandatory requirement to report to the UH Management Office the next duty day for in-processing.</p>
                <h3>Resident Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>You will be expected to keep your room and any shared living space clean and tidy. Cleaning supplies and equipment can be provided to you free of charge. You will also be accountable for your room and the furnishings provided. Residents may be held liable for any damages beyond normal fair wear and tear. See your ADL or UH Management Office representative if you have any questions about your resident responsibilities.</p>
                <h3>Inspection Program</h3>
                <p>The Installation Commander establishes a base-wide UH inspection program focused on health and safety. Squadron Commanders and unit First Sergeants implement the inspection program and visit rooms to ensure that all residents from their squadron comply with installation standards.</p>
                <h3>Bay Orderly Program</h3>
                <p>UH residents are expected to assist in the cleaning and upkeep of common areas and shared facilities of their "home." You will periodically be detailed to perform essential cleaning and minor maintenance around the UH campus.</p>
                <h3>Dormitory Councils</h3>
                <p>The Airmen Dormitory Council is the forum by which residents of an individual dormitory or group of dormitories address concerns about their living environment with a panel of their peers. The purpose of the council is to establish standards for all residents, present solutions for problem areas, establish positive recreational activities and identify facility and furnishing improvements. Participation at your location is a chance to be involved in shaping your living environment and provides an opportunity for personal growth and development in the areas of leadership and personal relationships. Ask your ADL or UH Management Office representative about how you can get involved.</p>
                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>It is mandatory for unaccompanied Airmen in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service to reside in UH. An E-4 residing in UH reaching 3 years of service may be authorized to move out of UH and into local community housing. Contact the UH Management Office for procedures you must follow to clear your room. In certain circumstances, such as to make space available for more junior Airmen, you may be authorized to move out of UH before reaching E-4 with greater than 3 years of service. The most senior Airmen are released first. Your ADL or UH Management Office representative will advise residents when early release is necessary.</p>
                <h3>Space Available Rooms</h3>
                <p>When there is an excess of dormitory rooms, personnel in the ranks of E-4 with greater than 3 years of service and above may be eligible to reside in UH on a space available basis. Contact the UH Management Office to inquire about availability.</p>
