                <h2 class="header">Privatized Housing</h2>
                <p id="getting-started-statement">At Tyndall Air Force Base, military family housing is privatized. Tyndall AFB Homes owns the family housing and is responsible for maintaining, repairing, constructing and managing the community. In addition to your option to purchase and rent housing in the local community, you now may choose to live in privatized housing by signing a tenant lease agreement with Tyndall AFB Homes.<br><br>For comprehensive information about the privatized housing community at Tyndall Air Force Base, visit the Tyndall AFB Homes website. The website provides information you need to know about the homes and amenities available in the privatized housing community.</p>
                <h3>Applying for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving to Tyndall Air Force Base. The government housing team will provide you the latest information about privatized housing and details about the application process. The MHO will also update you on any base specific policies regarding residing in privatized housing. You may submit an application online by visiting the Tyndall AFB Homes website and view documents, floor plans, and community activities offered in privatized housing.</p>
                <h3>Community Amenities</h3>
                <p>Privatized housing is comparable to housing in the local community and provides a wide variety of amenities and support services.<br><br>Community features such as community center, swimming pool, tennis, basketball, and volleyball courts, playgrounds, and walking trails are just some of the amenities you will find at Tyndall AFB Homes.<br><br>As a potential resident of privatized housing, contact the Property Management Office to obtain more specific information on the services available at your location.</p>
                <h3>Paying Rent for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Similar to living in the local community, you will sign a tenant lease agreement, typically for a one-year term. Your lease includes a military clause and a lease termination clause. You pay your monthly rent by authorizing an allotment of your BAH that is paid directly to the Property Manager. If your move occurs prior to the allotment start date, then you will need to pay the pro-rated rent directly to the Property Manager. The Tenant Lease Agreement spells out all relevant rent payment terms and conditions.</p>
                <h3>Gas and Electric Utilities</h3>
                <p>At this location, homes in the community are metered and you will be billed directly for gas and electric. Tyndall AFB Homes manages and collects your utility bill based on personal consumption. Since the homes are metered, you will retain a portion of the BAH to pay the utilities directly. The utility allowance is determined based on 110 percent of the estimated average utility cost (gas and electric) for each unit type. The more energy you conserve, the more money you keep in your pocket! For more information about your utilities, please contact the Property Management Office.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>Before purchasing your insurance, please consult the Property Management Office for more information about coverage.</p>

                <h2 class="header">Unaccompanied Housing</h2>
                <p id="heat-statement">At Tyndall AFB, we strive to create an inclusive environment that cultivates the development and training of Airmen. UH is provided for unaccompanied Airmen in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service. Each Airman is provided a private sleeping room, furnishings, bed linens and supplies required for comfortable living. (Room arrangements may vary depending on location)
                    <br><br>Unaccompanied Airmen in the rank of E-4 with greater than 3 years of service and above will move into housing in the local community. Please refer to the Housing in the Local Community section for information and assistance on securing housing. The permanent party UH campus at Tyndall Air Force Base consists of single occupancy rooms with the following configurations: 4+1 (Dorms 4 Airmen, D4A) which have four rooms that share a common area with a full kitchen, 1+1 (shared kitchen), 1+1 (shared bathroom) and private suites (no shared kitchen/bathroom).
                    <br><br>The campus is centrally located with many great base facilities close by. The dining facility, fitness center/HAWC, base pool, Horizons club, auto hobby shop, library, bowling center, Base Exchange, Commissary, alterations, shoppette, class six, and military clothing sales are all within walking distance. The white sandy beaches of the Gulf of Mexico are just down the road about a mile from the dorms.
                    </p>
                <h3>Amenities</h3>
                <p>On campus, there are four centrally located laundry facilities, as well as stacked washer/dryer units shared between four rooms in the D4A dorms and two rooms in 1036. Vacuums are provided for nearly every room, with the exception of the D4A dorms which share one between four rooms. The dayrooms have LCD televisions, new lounge furniture and tables, as well as several pool tables and air hockey tables. Two of the dayrooms even have a full kitchen. Additionally, there are gazebos near each of the dorms that have relatively new patio furniture and gas grills. Specific Restrictions at Tyndall AFB include: No smoking in the dorm rooms, there are designated tobacco use areas located outside, near each dorm building. With few exceptions, pets are not allowed in the dorms. Fish and small birds, (in a reasonable quantity) are allowed without prior approval. Any other types of animals, insects, etc. require approval from the dormitory superintendant / senior ADL, and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Other restrictions include: No weapons, overnight visitors, underage drinking, or underage visitors (except family members).</p>
                <h3>Base Specific Policy</h3>
                <p>During your orientation, the ADL or UH Management Office representative will inform you of all Air Force and base-specific policies.</p>
                <h3>UH Management Office Staff</h3>
                <p>The UH Management Office is staffed with professionals that can assist with all of your housing needs. Staffs vary but can be comprised of non-commissioned officers (NCO), Senior NCOs and some bases have civilian employees. The assigned military are Airman Dormitory Leaders (ADL). These members are highly motivated personnel dedicated to ensuring that residents receive quality service. ADLs will provide you guidance and advice on UH life as well as mentor you on succeeding in the Air Force.</p>
                <h3>Assignment Procedures</h3>
                <p>As soon as you are notified of your assignment, contact your gaining unit and request to be assigned a sponsor. Your sponsor will be another military member assigned to your unit and will assist with your move. The sponsor or gaining unit must then contact the UH Management Office to notify them of your impending arrival date and work to secure you a dormitory room.</p>
                <h3>Unit Integrity</h3>
                <p>In most cases, you will be assigned a room in an area of the dormitory set aside for the personnel who work in your unit. This is to promote camaraderie among squadron members. If a room is not available near other members of your unit, you may be assigned a temporary room until one with your unit becomes available.</p>
                <h3>Planning Your Move</h3>
                <p>Prior to travel, arrange to meet your sponsor or someone from your unit upon arrival at the gaining installation. If you arrive on a business day during normal duty hours, have your sponsor escort you to the UH Management Office. An ADL or a civilian Dorm Manager will take you through the process of checking you into your room and performing a move-in inspection and inventory of the allotted furnishings and supplies.
                    <br><br>If you arrive on the weekend or after normal duty hours, have your sponsor make arrangements to pick up your room key from the UH Management Office or acquire a hospitality room for you until you can meet with an ADL or Dorm Manager. If you obtain your room key outside of normal duty hours, it is still a mandatory requirement to report to the UH Management Office the next duty day to schedule you for an in-processing briefing. Linens will be provided to you when you arrive, if you need them. If your sponsor will be setting up your room, please let them know whether or not you will need linens. The ADL will give them to your sponsor when they pick up your room key.
                    <br><br>There is limited storage space provided for each resident dependant on the building you occupy. The new D4A dorms have a centralized storage area located in building 1052 next to the dorm leader's office. All other buildings have a storage room with open shelving on each floor, with the exception of building 1680 which has no storage outside of the rooms. We strongly recommend using a sturdy, lockable container if you would like to store anything in the storage rooms. These rooms have a locked outside door, however, they are not equipped with individual, locking enclosures inside.
                    <br><br>All of the rooms on campus have either a full or twin size captain's bed, which have drawers and under-bed storage. Each room is also furnished with an eight drawer dresser and a desk. Additionally, several of the buildings have a private walk in closet in the bedroom. The ones that do not are furnished with full size wardrobes.
                    </p>
                <h3>Resident Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>You will be expected to keep your room and any shared living space clean and tidy. Cleaning supplies and equipment can be provided to you free of charge. You will also be accountable for your room and the furnishings provided. Residents may be held liable for any damages beyond normal fair wear and tear. See your ADL or UH Management Office representative if you have any questions about your resident responsibilities.</p>
                <h3>Inspection Program</h3>
                <p>The Installation Commander establishes a base-wide UH inspection program focused on health and safety. Squadron Commanders and unit First Sergeants implement the inspection program and visit rooms to ensure that all residents from their squadron comply with installation standards.
