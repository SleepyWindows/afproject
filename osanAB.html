                <p id="getting-started-statement">For many families, living in government housing provides easy access to a wealth of community services and amenities such as schools, youth programs, Commissary/Exchange, and food services. This is especially true in overseas locations where you will find yourself dependent on the support facilities and services on the installation much more than those in the U.S. Living in government housing provides a safe and secure place to reside and provides a mentoring and supportive environment for families. Government housing is provided to military members who meet the appropriate criteria.<br><br>This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Members with dependents authorized to reside with them</li>
                    <li>Military-Married-to-Military couples assigned to same or adjacent base and reside jointly</li>
                    <li>Civilian employees designated by the installation commander as Key and Essential</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Contact the Military Housing Office (MHO) if you have any questions about the housing eligibility criteria at this location.<br><br>We are required by AFI 32-6000 to maintain 98% occupancy in Military Family Housing here at Osan Air Base. This may affect your ability to choose between on/off base housing. Please notify the Housing Office if you have any extenuating circumstances or other requirements that may affect your housing selection that you would like to address prior to your arrival.</p>

                    <li>Government furniture may not be removed from the dorm room without prior approval</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Base Specific Policy</h3>
                <p>During your orientation, the ADL or UH Management Office representative will inform you of all Air Force and base-specific policies.</p>
                <h3>UH Management Office Staff</h3>
                <p>The UH Management Office is staffed with professionals that can assist with all of your housing needs. Staffs vary but can be comprised of non-commissioned officers (NCO), Senior NCOs and some bases have civilian employees. The assigned military are Airman Dormitory Leaders (ADL). These members are highly motivated personnel dedicated to ensuring that residents receive quality service. ADLs will provide you guidance and advice on UH life as well as mentor you on succeeding in the Air Force.</p>
                <h3>Assignment Procedures</h3>
                <p>As soon as you are notified of your assignment, contact your gaining unit and request to be assigned a sponsor. Your sponsor will be another military member assigned to your unit and will assist with your move. The sponsor or gaining unit must then contact the UH Management Office to notify them of your impending arrival date and work to secure a dormitory room for you.</p>
                <h3>Unit Integrity</h3>
                <p>In most cases, you will be assigned a room in an area of the dormitory set aside for the personnel who work in your unit. This is to promote camaraderie among squadron members. If a room is not available near other members of your unit, you may be assigned a temporary room until one with your unit becomes available.</p>
                <h3>Planning Your Move</h3>
                <p>Prior to travel, arrange to meet your sponsor or someone from your unit upon arrival at the gaining installation.

                    <br><br>If you arrive on a business day during normal duty hours, have your sponsor escort you to the UH Management Office. An ADL or a civilian Dorm Manager will take you through the process of checking you into your room and performing a move-in inspection and inventory of the allotted furnishings and supplies.
                    
                    <br><br>If you arrive on the weekend or after normal duty hours, have your sponsor make arrangements to pick up your room key from the UH Management Office or acquire a hospitality room for you until you can meet with an ADL or Dorm Manager. If you obtain your room key outside of normal duty hours, it is still a mandatory requirement to report to the UH Management Office the next duty day for in-processing.
