                        <p>The Department of Defense is committed to ensuring that privatized housing Tenants (military service members and their families) receive quality housing and fair treatment from the Military Housing Privatization Initiative project owners that operate and maintain privatized housing.  The FY20 National Defense Authorization Act set out 18 rights of military service members and their families (Tenants) residing in privatized housing, and the DoD is committed to providing the full benefit of the 15 rights.  The DoD will continue to work with MHPI companies to ensure the full benefits of the remaining three rights become available.
