                <h2 class="header">Privatized Housing</h2>
                <p id="getting-started-statement">At the Air Force Academy, military family housing is privatized. Air Force Academy Family Housing, A Hunt Community owns the family housing and Residential Management is responsible for maintaining, repairing, and managing the community. In addition to your option to purchase and rent housing in the local community, you now may choose to live in privatized housing by signing a tenant lease agreement. For comprehensive information about the privatized housing community at the Air Force Academy visit the Air Force Academy Family Housing website. The website provides information you need to know about the homes and amenities available in the privatized housing community.</p>
                <h3>Applying for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving to the Air Force Academy. The government housing team will provide you the latest information about privatized housing and details about the application process. The MHO will also update you on any base specific policies regarding residing in privatized housing.</p>
                <h3>Community Amenities</h3>
                <p>Privatized housing is comparable to housing in the local community and provides a wide variety of amenities and support services. Community Features Include: - 24-hour "live" service requests - On-call maintenance - FREE renters insurance - Landscaping - Snow removal - Community activities - Deployed spouse program - Incentive-based recycling reward program Contact Air Force Academy Family Housing to obtain more information on the services available at the USAF Academy.</p>
                <h3>Paying Rent for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Similar to living in the local community, you will sign a tenant lease agreement, typically for a 1-year term. Your lease includes a military clause and a lease termination clause. You pay your monthly rent by authorizing an allotment of your BAH, which is paid directly to the Property Manager. If your move occurs prior to the allotment start date, you will need to pay the pro-rated rent directly to the Property Manager. Here at the Air Force Academy, rent is paid in arrears (at the end of the month). The Tenant Lease Agreement spells out all relevant rent payment terms and conditions.</p>
                <h3>Gas and Electric Utilities</h3>
                <p>At this time, homes in the community are not metered and your rent will include these utility costs, up to your full BAH amount. For more information about your utilities, please contact the Property Management Office.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>Hunt provides rental insurance: $20,000 personal property and $100,000 liability per occurrence. Should you have a claim, you may have a $250 deductable. If you need additional insurance, you are encouraged to shop around and choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle. Before purchasing additional insurance, please consult with Hunt for information about coverage.</p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>

                <p>The UH Manager will inform you of all Air Force and base specific policies during your orientation. Contact the UH Management Office for specific concerns.</p>
                <h3>Assignment Procedures</h3>
                <p>As soon as you are notified of your assignment, contact your gaining unit and request to be assigned a sponsor. Your sponsor will be another military member assigned to your unit and will assist with your move. The sponsor or gaining unit must then contact the UH Management Office to notify them of your impending arrival date and work to secure you a dormitory room.</p>
                <h3>Unit Integrity</h3>
                <p>In most cases, you will be assigned a room in an area of the dormitory set aside for the personnel who work in your unit. This is to promote camaraderie among squadron members. If a room is not available near other members of your unit, you may be assigned a temporary room until one with your unit becomes available.</p>
                <h3>Planning Your Move</h3>
                <p>Prior to travel, arrange to meet your sponsor or someone from your unit upon arrival at the gaining installation.<br><br>If you arrive on a business day during normal duty hours, have your sponsor escort you to the UH Management Office. The Dorm Manager will process you into your room and perform a move-in inspection and inventory of the allotted furnishings and supplies.<br><br>If you arrive on the weekend or after normal duty hours, have your sponsor make arrangements to pick up your room key from the UH Management Office or acquire a hospitality room for you until you can in-process with the Dorm Manager.<br><br>If you obtain your room key outside of normal duty hours, it is still a mandatory requirement to report to the UH Management Office the next duty day for in-processing.</p>
                <h3>Resident Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>You will be expected to keep your room and any shared living space clean and tidy. The common areas are currently contract cleaned. You will be accountable for your room and the furnishings provided. Residents may be held liable for any damages beyond normal fair wear and tear.<br><br>See your Dorm Manager if you have any questions about your resident responsibilities.</p>
                <h3>Inspection Program</h3>
                <p>The Installation Commander establishes a base-wide UH inspection program focused on health and safety. Squadron Commanders and unit First Sergeants implement the inspection program and visit rooms to ensure that all residents from their squadron comply with installation standards.</p>
                <h3>Dormitory Council</h3>
                <p>The Airmen Dormitory Council is the forum by which residents of an individual dormitory or group of dormitories address concerns about their living environment with a panel of their peers. The purpose of the council is to establish standards for all residents, present solutions for problem areas, establish positive recreational activities and identify facility and furnishing improvements. Participation at your location is a chance to be involved in shaping your living environment and provides an opportunity for personal growth and development in the areas of leadership and personal relationships. Ask your Dorm Manager how you can get involved.</p>
                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>It is mandatory for unaccompanied Airmen in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service to reside in UH. An E-4 residing in UH reaching 3 years of service may be authorized to move out of UH and into local community housing. Contact the UH Management Office for procedures you must follow to clear your room. In certain circumstances, such as to make space available for more junior Airmen, you may be authorized to move out of UH before reaching E-4 with greater than 3 years of service. The most senior Airmen are released first. Your Dorm Manager will advise residents when early release is necessary.</p>
                <h3>Space Available Rooms</h3>
                <p>When there is an excess of dormitory rooms, personnel in the ranks of E-4 with greater than 3 years of service and above may be eligible to reside in UH on a space available basis. Contact the Dorm Manager to inquire about availability of space.</p>
