                <p id="getting-started-statement">For many families, living in government housing provides easy access to community services and amenities such as schools, youth programs, Commissary/Exchange, and food services. This is especially true in overseas locations where you will find yourself dependent on the support facilities and services on the installation much more than in the U.S. Living in government housing provides a safe and secure place to reside and provides a mentoring and supportive environment for families.<br><br>All accompanied members are required to report to the Military Housing Office NLT 48 hours (2 Business Days) after arrival.<br><br>Government housing is provided to military members who meet the following criteria:
                </p>

Further, you are not entitled to ship items back to the continental U.S. (CONUS) for non-temporary storage (NTS).

                <p id="heat-statement">At Yokota AB we strive to create an inclusive environment that cultivates the development and training of Airmen. The Air Force recognizes that the management of Unaccompanied Housing (UH) facilities is critical to an Airman's development process. UH is a personal residence and we strive to provide a modern, functional, well maintained and comfortable home, as well as promote pride, professionalism and personal dignity.

                <h3>Unit Integrity</h3>

                <h3>Shipment of Household goods</h3>
                <p>When shipping household goods, although members may be authorized to ship their full weight allowance IAW JFTR, we highly recommend for you to limit HHG shipment to necessity/essential items and avoid shipping bulk items.

Local rental storage units are very limited and expensive.</p>
                <h3>Community Housing Units</h3>
                <p>Japanese homes, especially in Tokyo, are built smaller compared to American standards. Living room areas, bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, hallways, stairwells, and closets are fairly small compared to the U.S. Durable straw mats called "tatami" mats cover some rooms in Japanese homes.<br><br>One tatami mat is approximately 3' x 6' and about 3" thick. The number of mats has become a measure for the size of a room. There are usually 6 tatami mats in a standard size room, which equals approximately 9' x 12'. Due to generally smaller sized rooms, it is recommended you carefully select the type and furniture size you bring to Japan. Western style homes are becoming available; however, quantities are limited.<br><br>Trash rules are different in each city. The common rule is you must separate burnable, unburnable, and recyclable refuse. A guideline for trash is available through each city hall and your landlord. Off-base trash may not be brought on base for disposal.<br><br>Electric power is slightly different between Japan and the U.S; Japan is 100 volts/50Hz, and the U.S. is 120 volts/60Hz. Most appliances, with the exception of appliances with timing devices installed, will work at this lower voltage, but check the data plate on the back of your devices before use.</p>
                <h3>Telephone, Internet and Television</h3>
                <p>Optical fiber and cable TV are becoming mainstreams for telephone (IP phone), internet, and TV services. If an antenna for digital broadcasting is already installed at your house, you will be able to watch Japanese TV channels. If you would like to watch American channels, you need to have either fiber-optic or cable TV. Decoder boxes may be available but is subject to availability by FMO.<br><br>The information below serves as a starting points to help you get a phone, Internet, and TV set up in your community housing. It is not an endorsement of the companies listed. You need to get permission from your landlord to install fiber-optic or cable TV beforehand. Below are the companies that provide fiber-optic or cable TV services:</p>

                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain personal property insurance for your possessions and to provide coverage for liability claims, medical payments to third parties, as well as damage to your home caused by theft, fire, storms, smoke, frozen pipes, and ice or snow. Damages caused by an earthquake are NOT included under personal property insurance. Earthquake coverage must be purchased separately. Personal Property Insurance will cost about ¥ 20,000 for two years. Earthquake coverage will range between ¥ 10,000 - 20,000 for two years on top of your personal property insurance.<br><br>Before purchasing your insurance, please consult the MHO for more information about coverage.</p>
