                <h2 class="header">Privatized Housing</h2>
                <p id="getting-started-statement">For many families, living in government housing provides easy access to a wealth of community services and amenities such as schools, youth programs, Commissary/Exhange, and food services. This is especially true in overseas locations where you will find yourself dependent on the support facilities and services on the installation much more than those in the U.S. Living within government housing provides a safe and secure place to reside and provides a mentoring and supportive environment for families.<br><br>Government housing is provided to military members who meet the appropriate criteria.<br><br>This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Members with dependents authorized to reside with them</li>
                        <li>Military-Married-to-Military couples assigned to same or adjacent base and reside jointly</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Contact the Military Housing Office (MHO) if you have any questions about the housing eligibility criteria at this location.<br><br>We offer government housing on base. Our inventory consists of duplex housing units with yards. All units have 110 volt, 60 cycle electrical service. Housing amenities include built-in closets, mini-blinds, built-in dishwasher, stove, oven, range-hood, refrigerator, microwave, washer, dryer and central AC/Heating. Houses have yards and a back porch with awning. Each unit has a carport. You will be responsible for yard maintenance.

                        Privately owned outside recreation equipment may be installed inside the back yards of houses with prior approval of the MHO. A school and playground is located within walking distance.
                        </p>

                <h2 class="header">Community Housing</h2>
                <h3>Housing in the Local Community</h3>
                <p id="faq-information">The Military Housing Office (MHO) provides all DoD personnel with a personalized service to assist in locating suitable housing in your new host country. Moving to a new country can often be confusing and stressful; however, it can also be exciting. Living off base provides members and families the chance to experience a new culture and make friends with their host country neighbors. The MHO will assist you every step of the way to help you find your new home in the local community.</p>
                <h3>Housing Services</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving. The government housing team will provide you the latest information on the local housing situation as well as local laws governing off-base housing. The MHO partners with landlords to make sure you receive the most current information about the local housing.

                    <br><br>The MHO monitors off-base rental listings to ensure that they are safe and adequate.
                    
                    <br><br>The MHO can assist you by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Providing translation services to establish appointments to view available units</li>

                    </ul>
                <p>Sponsors are relied upon to provide transportation to assist members in their house hunting. The MHO can assist also in locating housing and providing transportation during normal duty hours. However this service is by appointment so please contact the MHO for further information. NOTE: Pets would limit your range of choices for community housing in any bedroom category.<br><br>After you move into your home, the MHO is available for on-going assistance with translation services should you need to communicate with your landlord.</p>
                <h3>Community Housing Units</h3>
                <p>The MHO provides up-to-date listings of available economy units, translation services, and landlord/tenant mediation.<br><br>Due to the size of Spanish bedrooms, it is recommended not to bring American size furniture such as king size beds. Also if you have a lot of furniture, like dining room and living room sets, remember the houses in Spain usually have only one living/dining room area. The average size of apartments is approximately 80-120m² (800-1200 sq ft) and houses 120-140m² (1200-1400 sq ft). We also remind you that this base does not have bonded temporary storage.<br><br>Community Housing consists mostly of furnished/unfurnished apartments, town-houses, and some individual homes. Most of these units are considerably smaller than U.S. houses. Although Spanish quarters do not resemble American homes, they can be made into comfortable living quarters. Electrical outlets are standard Spanish voltage 220V/50HZ. Individual homes can be found with swimming pools and usually have yards.<br><br>All Spanish houses have combination Air Conditioning/Heating units, either individual or centralized. Appliances such as electric stove, oven and range-hood are standard. Some houses are equipped with refrigerator, microwave, washer and dryer and we will supply any items that are not present.<br><br>The approximate monthly cost of rental homes/apartments in the economy area is between 500 Euros to 900 Euros. The average monthly cost for utilities (water, gas and electricity) runs between 250 Euros to 500 Euros.<br><br>Commercial transportation off base is very good, and there are good connections to the main city, Sevilla, by train and bus. However it is recommended that you ship your vehicle well in advance of your arrival to Morón.<br><br>For information about the housing allowances that financially support your move, see Referral and Relocation Assistance.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle.</p>
                <h3>Realtor Services</h3>
                <p>The use of local realtor services is typically unnecessary and is not recommended unless a home for rent is only listed with a specific realtor. In OCONUS, if you choose to use realtor services, discuss fees up front, as some realtors charge a finder's fee and government reimbursement is rarely authorized. To request government reimbursement for realtor services in OCONUS, you must submit a request for authorization through the MHO before signing a lease or contract. In CONUS, fees for realtor services are not reimbursable.</p>
