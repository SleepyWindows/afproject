                <h3>Housing in the Local Community</h3>
                <p id="faq-information">The Military Housing Office (MHO) provides all DoD personnel with a personalized service to assist in locating suitable housing in your new host country. Moving to a new country can often be confusing and stressful; however, it can also be exciting. Living locally provides members and families the chance to experience a new culture and make friends with their host country neighbors. The MHO will assist you every step of the way to help you find your new home in the local community.</p>
                <h3>Housing Services</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving. The government housing team will provide you the latest information on the local housing situation as well as local laws governing off-base housing. The MHO partners with landlords, realtors and property managers to make sure you receive the most current information about the local housing market.<br><br>The MHO monitors off-base rental listings to ensure that they are safe and adequate. You can begin your search for off-base housing options with Right Move at https://www.rightmove.co.uk.<br><br>The MHO can assist you by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing translation services to establish appointments to view available units</li>
                    <li>Negotiating lease contracts</li>
                    <li>Assisting in establishing utility services</li>
                    <li>Providing furnishings support. See Furnishings Management for a list of the Duration of Tour Items available.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you arrive in the UK your sponsor should show you around the area and help you find local realtor services. Your sponsor should also be able to drive you to realtor appointments until you have your own vehicle.<br><br>After you move into your home, the MHO is available for on-going assistance with translation services should you need to communicate with your landlord.</p>
                <h3>Community Housing Units</h3>
                <p>The MHO provides up-to-date listings of available economy units, translation services, and landlord/tenant mediation.<br><br>There is always a good selection of rental homes in local towns and villages. The selection includes modern properties on housing estates, in apartment blocks or old cottages and conversions of older buildings like barns. Homes in the UK are generally smaller than homes in the US and staircases are usually much narrower. You may want to consider leaving very large pieces of furniture behind; e.g. California king size bed.<br><br>For information about the housing allowances that financially support your move, see Referral and Relocation Assistance.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle.<br><br>Many agents will insist you have insurance to an agreed amount to cover any serious damage to a rental property.<br><br>Before purchasing your insurance, please consult the MHO for more information about coverage.</p>
                <h3>Realtor Services</h3>
                <p>The use of local realtor services is typically unnecessary and is not recommended unless a home for rent is only listed with a specific realtor. In OCONUS, if you choose to use realtor services, discuss fees up front, as some realtors charge a finder's fee and government reimbursement is rarely authorized. To request government reimbursement for realtor services in OCONUS, you must submit a request for authorization through the MHO before signing a lease or contract. In CONUS, fees for realtor services are not reimbursable.<br><br>The Housing Office will pass you a list of local letting agents. Please note that they do not usually offer a service to transport you to viewings public or private.</p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>
                <p>Contact the School Liason Office for information on local school options at schoolliason.alconbury.us.af.mil or DSN: 314-262-4079/Commercial: 01423 774079</p>
