                <h2 class="header">Unaccompanied Housing</h2>
                <p id="heat-statement">At Clear AFS we strive to create an inclusive environment that cultivates the development and training of Airmen. The Air Force recognizes that the management of Unaccompanied Housing (UH) facilities is critical to an Airman's development process. UH is a personal residence and we strive to provide a modern, functional, well maintained and comfortable home, as well as promote pride, professionalism and personal dignity.<br><br>UH is provided for all Active Duty Air Force and all Active Duty Guard (AGR's) that live more than 35 miles away. Each AirmanE-1-E-6 is provided a private sleeping room, furnishings, bed linens and supplies required for comfortable living. (Room arrangements may vary depending on location)<br><br>Unaccompanied Airmen that are in the rank of E-7 and above that live outside the 35 mile zone will be provided with a two room suite. Officers will also be given a two room suite.<br><br>The permanent party UH campus at Clear AFS consists of two room suites for E-7 and above and either one plus ones or quads for E-6 and below. A one plus one is two separate rooms that share a common kitchen and bath. The Quads are 4 separate rooms with private bath that share a common kitchen area.<br><br>Amenities include a refrigerator, microwave and stove in the suites and one plus ones. Refrigerators, convection microwave, cook top and a dishwasher are provided in the quads. All dorms have a common laundry room on each floor that has four washers and four dryers.<br><br>Restrictions at CAFS include no smoking in the rooms, no guests without permission and no storage of weapons or flammables.</p>
                <h3>Base Specific Policy</h3>
                <p>During your orientation you will be informed of all Air Force and base-specific policies.</p>
                <h3>Assignment Procedures</h3>
                <p>As soon as you are notified of your assignment, contact your gaining unit and request to be assigned a sponsor. Your sponsor will be another military member assigned to your unit and will assist with your move. The sponsor or gaining unit will then contact the Dorm Office to notify them of your impending arrival date and work to secure you a dormitory room.</p>
                <h3>Unit Integrity</h3>
                <p>Due to our location and small unit and depending on your gender and rank you may or may not be housed near or with someone from your section. We do try to put the security forces and radar operators together, but beyond that assignment is based on where there is room available.</p>
                <h3>Planning Your Move</h3>
                <p>Prior to travel, arrange to meet your sponsor or someone from your unit upon arrival at the gaining installation.<br><br>If you arrive on a business day during normal duty hours, have your sponsor escort you to the Dorm Office. Your sponsor or appointed representative and/or the Dorm Manager will take you through the process of checking you into your room and performing a move-in inspection and inventory of the allotted furnishings and supplies.<br><br>If you arrive on the weekend or after normal duty hours, have your sponsor make arrangements to pick up your room key from the Dorm Office or acquire a hospitality room for you until you can meet with the Dorm Manager. We also have a Duty Manager on call that may meet you if your sponsor is not able to.<br><br>If you obtain your room key outside of normal duty hours, it is still a mandatory requirement to report to the Dorm Office the next duty day for in-processing.</p>
                <h3>Resident Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>You will be expected to keep your room and any shared living space clean and tidy. You will also be accountable for your room and the furnishings provided. Residents may be held liable for any damages beyond normal fair wear and tear. See the Dorm Office representative if you have any questions about your resident responsibilities.</p>
                <h3>Inspection Program</h3>
                <p>The Installation Commander establishes a base-wide UH inspection program focused on health and safety. Squadron Commanders and unit First Sergeants implement the inspection program and visit rooms to ensure that all residents from their squadron comply with installation standards.</p>
                <h3>Bay Orderly Program</h3>
                <p>There is no bay orderly at CAFS. All cleaning outside of your room is done by a contractor.</p>
                <h3>Dormitory Councils</h3>
                <p>The Airmen Dormitory Council is the forum by which residents of an individual dormitory or group of dormitories address concerns about their living environment with a panel of their peers. The purpose of the council is to establish standards for all residents, present solutions for problem areas, establish positive recreational activities and identify facility and furnishing improvements. Participation at your location is a chance to be involved in shaping your living environment and provides an opportunity for personal growth and development in the areas of leadership and personal relationships. Ask your Dorm Management Office representative about how you can get involved.</p>
                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>Contact the Dorm Management Office for procedures you must follow to clear your room.</p>
