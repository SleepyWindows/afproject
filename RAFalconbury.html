                <h3>Applying for Government Housing</h3>
                <p>If you desire to live in government housing, please submit an advance application for assignment (DD Form 1746) through the MHO at your losing installation with a complete copy of your PCS orders. The effective date of the application (i.e. the date you become eligible for base housing) is the date you depart your prior installation (including members with TDY en route) or the date ordered to active duty. This date is also used to determine the order of precedence when managing the respective waitlists. Applications can also be submitted upon arrival during your first visit to the MHO. MHO staff will be able to assist in the completion of the application and will review PCS orders and housing options with you. For walk-in applications, as long as you apply for government housing within 30 days of arrival, you will be placed on the waiting list effective the date you departed from your previous installation. After 30 days, the application date will be the date of the walk-in. Please be sure your application identifies and includes supporting documentation for an impending promotion or gain of dependents so that you can be placed on the appropriate waiting list. Per AFI 32-6000 “Members with an impending entitlement (promotion, increase in the number or maturation of dependent) that would entitle member to an additional bedroom in the following 12 months must provide supporting documentation and note the entitlement in the remarks section of the application. Members applying at the Housing Flight provide documentation with the housing application. Members applying online provide information on the advance application, print a confirmation copy and present the online application and supporting documentation to the gaining Housing Flight upon arrival. The Housing Flight requires a physician statement to confirm pregnancy and a written statement from the military personnel flight (MPF) to confirm selection for promotion.”</p>

                <h3>UH Management Office Staff</h3>
                <p>The UH Management Office is staffed with professionals that can assist with all of your housing needs. Staffs vary but can be comprised of non-commissioned officers (NCO), Senior NCOs and some bases have civilian employees. The assigned military are Airman Dormitory Leaders (ADL). These members are highly motivated personnel dedicated to ensuring that residents receive quality service. ADLs will provide you guidance and advice on UH life as well as mentor you on succeeding in the Air Force.</p>
                <h3>Assignment Procedures</h3>
                <p>As soon as you are notified of your assignment, contact your gaining unit and request to be assigned a sponsor. Your sponsor will be another military member assigned to your unit and will assist with your move. The sponsor or gaining unit must then contact the UH Management Office to notify them of your impending arrival date and work to secure you a dormitory room.</p>
                <h3>Unit Integrity</h3>
                <p>In most cases, you will be assigned a room in an area of the dormitory set aside for the personnel who work in your unit. This is to promote camaraderie among squadron members. If a room is not available near other members of your unit, you may be assigned a temporary room until one with your unit becomes available.</p>
                <h3>Planning Your Move</h3>
                <p>Prior to travel, arrange to meet your sponsor or someone from your unit upon arrival at the gaining installation.<br><br>If you arrive on a business day during normal duty hours, have your sponsor escort you to the UH Management Office. An ADL or a civilian Dorm Manager will take you through the process of checking you into your room and performing a move-in inspection and inventory of the allotted furnishings and supplies.<br><br>If you arrive on the weekend or after normal duty hours, have your sponsor make arrangements to pick up your room key from the UH Management Office or acquire a hospitality room for you until you can meet with an ADL or Dorm Manager.<br><br>If you obtain your room key outside of normal duty hours, it is still a mandatory requirement to report to the UH Management Office the next duty day for in-processing.</p>
                <h3>Resident Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>You will be expected to keep your room and any shared living space clean and tidy. Cleaning supplies and equipment can be provided to you free of charge. You will also be accountable for your room and the furnishings provided. Residents may be held liable for any damages beyond normal fair wear and tear.<br><br>See your ADL or UH Management Office representative if you have any questions about your resident responsibilities.</p>
                <h3>Inspection Program</h3>
                <p>The Installation Commander establishes a base-wide UH inspection program focused on health and safety. Squadron Commanders and unit First Sergeants implement the inspection program and visit rooms to ensure that all residents from their squadron comply with installation standards.</p>
                <h3>Bay Orderly Program</h3>
                <p>UH residents are expected to assist in the cleaning and upkeep of common areas and shared facilities of their "home." You will periodically be detailed to perform essential cleaning and minor maintenance around the UH campus.</p>
                <h3>Dormitory Councils</h3>
                <p>The Airmen Dormitory Council is the forum by which residents of an individual dormitory or group of dormitories address concerns about their living environment with a panel of their peers. The purpose of the council is to establish standards for all residents, present solutions for problem areas, establish positive recreational activities and identify facility and furnishing improvements. Participation at your location is a chance to be involved in shaping your living environment and provides an opportunity for personal growth and development in the areas of leadership and personal relationships.<br><br>Ask your ADL or UH Management Office representative about how you can get involved.</p>
                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>It is mandatory for unaccompanied Airmen in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service to reside in UH. An E-4 residing in UH reaching 3 years of service may be authorized to move out of UH and into local community housing. Contact the UH Management Office for procedures you must follow to clear your room. In certain circumstances, such as to make space available for more junior Airmen, you may be authorized to move out of UH before reaching E-4 with greater than 3 years of service. The most senior Airmen are released first. Your ADL or UH Management Office representative will advise residents when early release is necessary.</p>
                <h3>Space Available Rooms</h3>
                <p>When there is an excess of dormitory rooms, personnel in the ranks of E-4 with greater than 3 years of service and above may be eligible to reside in UH on a space available basis. For space available, a form has to be signed stating UH may have to give 30 days notice if the room is required for a junior member who is priority 2, space required.<br><br>Contact the UH Management Office to inquire about availability.</p>

                <h2 class="header">Community Housing</h2>
                <h3>Housing in the Local Community</h3>
                <p id="faq-information">The Military Housing Office (MHO) provides all DoD personnel with a personalized service to assist in locating suitable housing in your new host country. Moving to a new country can often be confusing and stressful; however, it can also be exciting. Living off base provides members and families the chance to experience a new culture and make friends with their host country neighbors. The MHO will assist you every step of the way to help you find your new home in the local community.</p>
                <h3>Housing Services</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving. The government housing team will provide you the latest information on the local housing situation as well as local laws governing off-base housing. The MHO partners with landlords, realtors and property managers to make sure you receive the most current information about the local housing market. The MHO can assist you by: - Reviewing leases and advising with regard to rental negotiations - Advise on establishing utility services - Providing temporary furniture and appliance support. Appliances such as washers, dryers, fridge/freezers, and electrical transformers are available for the duration of your tour. Unfortunately, these services are only available for military and DoD employees and are not available for contractor employees.<br><br>Depending on availability, Alconbury can offer the service to provide transportation to members and their families to view RPP properties. Child seats will need to be provided and installed into the vehicle by the service member.</p>
                <h3>Rental Partnership Program</h3>
                <p>At RAF Alconbury, the MHO supports the Rental Partnership Program to help military members obtain adequate housing in the community. The MHO and local landlords enter into agreements to offer service members special rental benefits above what other tenants receive. Typical benefits might include not having to undergo a credit check or pay application fees, and immediate access to housing. Contact the MHO for more information about this program. You can also click here for a link to Homes.mil where you can search by base for our available listings.<br><br>You can also search for available local rental properties at:</p>

                </ul>
                <h3>Community Housing Units</h3>
                <p>After you move into your home, the MHO is available for on-going assistance with advisory and mediation services if needed.. The square footage of UK properties is generally smaller than those in the USA and fitted closets are not an everyday feature. The major appliances are generally of a smaller dimension and capacity although available from FMO they may also be provided by landlords. For information about the housing allowances that financially support your move, please email 423ces.housing@us.af.mil if military. If you are civilian, you will need to contact your respective Civilian Personnel Office for this information.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance if you want your possessions to be insured in case of theft, accident, or disaster and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle. It is suggested that tenants take out accidental damage coverage when purchasing renters insurance. Before purchasing your insurance, please consult the MHO for more information about coverage.</p>
                <h3>Realtor Services</h3>
                <p>In the U.K., listing properties for rent is primarily conducted via a web-based portal such as Right Move, or Zoopla. Rarely will you find the need to remain with only one agency. Please be aware that the majority of fees cannot be charged to a tenant, please ensure you are liaising with the referrals team if you have any questions or concerns as fees are not reimbursable by the government. Further, do not sign any lease before we have had an opportunity to review it and conduct an adequacy inspection on the property. Also, please be advised that if you ask for an agent to hold a property for you, you may be obligated to pay a holding deposit that is not reimbursable by the government. Do not accept a property or sign any lease prior to arriving and without seeing a property for yourself. Many factors, such as the ability of your furniture to be moved through hallways and stairs and fitting in the rooms, cannot be accurately determined without being physically present. In short, nobody knows your needs like you do.</p>
                <h3>Off-Base Community School Information</h3>
                <p>Contact the School Liason at DSN: 314-268-3232/Commercial: +44 01480 843232 or email at school liason.alconbury@us.af.mil for information regarding schooling options for your children.</p>
