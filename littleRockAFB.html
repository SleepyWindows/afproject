                <h2 class="header">Privatized Housing</h2>
                <p id="getting-started-statement">At Little Rock AFB, military family housing is privatized. HP Communities, LLC owns the family housing and is responsible for maintaining, repairing, constructing and managing the community. In addition to your option to purchase and rent housing in the local community, you now may choose to live in privatized housing by signing a tenant lease agreement with Little Rock Privatized Housing Project Management Office (PMO).<br><br>For comprehensive information about homes and amenities available in the Little Rock privatized housing community, visit the Little Rock Family Housing website.</p>
                <h3>Applying for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving to Little Rock. The government housing team will provide you the latest information about privatized housing and details about the application process. The MHO will also update you on any base specific policies on residing in privatized housing.<br><br>You may submit an Application for Assignment to Housing (DD Form 1746 found under The Important Links section fo this page) from your departing installation or go to Little Rock PMO to apply and view documents, floor plans, and amenities in privatized housing.
                </p>
                <h3>Community Amenities</h3>
                <p>Privatized housing is comparable to housing in the local community and provides a wide variety of amenities and support services, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Welcome Center with Fitness Room</li>
                    <li>Playgrounds, pool</li>
                    <li>Spray ground</li>
                    <li>Dog park</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Paying Rent for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Similar to living in the local community, you will sign a tenant lease agreement, typically for a 1-year term. Your lease includes a military clause and a lease termination clause. You pay your monthly rent by authorizing an allotment of your Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) directly to the PH PMO. The Tenant Lease Agreement spells out relevant rent payment terms and conditions. If you are active duty, military retiree, retired civil servant, DOD contractor, or general public and are renting a market rate home, your rent is a set amount as agreed to in your lease. It is not based on your BAH.</p>
                <h3>Electric Utilities</h3>
                <p>Although homes are metered at this location, residents are not being billed. Until that time Little Rock Family Housing will bear the responsibility for payment of the electric bill.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>The Little Rock PH PMO will make personal property renters insurance coverage of $20,000 available to you, which insures against theft, fire, lightning, windstorm, hail, explosion, smoke damage, etc. The policy also provides $100,000 in liability coverage. You must apply for the coverage and pay the $250.00 deductible.<br><br>If you feel this coverage is inadequate to cover your personal property, you should obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle. Contact the HP PMO at (501) 983-9044 for more information.</p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>
                <p>For families, we understand that where your children attend school plays a large factor in the decision of where to live. Parents of school-age children are encouraged to research schools prior to signing a lease for housing.<br><br>Little Rock AFB Charter School is located on the base for grades 5-8. Contact the School Liaison Officer at 504-987-8941 or School.Liaison@littlerock.af.mil.<br><br>School Districts (Transfers are available across district lines, but specific rules apply)</p>

                <h3>Base Specific Policy</h3>
                <p>During your orientation, the ADL or UH Management Office representative will inform you of all Air Force and base-specific policies.</p>
                <h3>UH Management Office Staff</h3>
                <p>The UH Management Office is staffed with professionals that can assist with all of your housing needs. Staffs vary but can be comprised of non-commissioned officers (NCO), Senior NCOs and some bases have civilian employees. The assigned military are Airman Dormitory Leaders (ADL). These members are highly motivated personnel dedicated to ensuring that residents receive quality service. ADLs will provide you guidance and advice on UH life as well as mentor you on succeeding in the Air Force.</p>
                <h3>Assignment Procedures</h3>
                <p>As soon as you are notified of your assignment, contact your gaining unit and request to be assigned a sponsor. Your sponsor will be another military member assigned to your unit and will assist with your move. The sponsor or gaining unit must then contact the UH Management Office to notify them of your impending arrival date and work to secure you a dormitory room.</p>
                <h3>Unit Integrity</h3>
                <p>In most cases, you will be assigned a room in an area of the dormitory set aside for the personnel who work in your unit. This is to promote camaraderie among squadron members. If a room is not available near other members of your unit, you may be assigned a temporary room until one with your unit becomes available.</p>
                <h3>Planning Your Move</h3>
                <p>Prior to travel, arrange to meet your sponsor or someone from your unit upon arrival at the gaining installation. If you arrive on a business day during normal duty hours, have your sponsor escort you to the UH Management Office. An ADL or a civilian Dorm Manager will take you through the process of checking you into your room and performing a move-in inspection and inventory of the allotted furnishings and supplies.<br><br>If you arrive on the weekend or after normal duty hours, have your sponsor make arrangements to pick up your room key from the UH Management Office or acquire a hospitality room for you until you can meet with an ADL or Dorm Manager. If you obtain your room key outside of normal duty hours, it is still a mandatory requirement to report to the UH Management Office the next duty day for in-processing.</p>
                <h3>Resident Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>You will be expected to keep your room and any shared living space clean and tidy. Cleaning supplies and equipment can be provided to you free of charge. You will also be accountable for your room and the furnishings provided. Residents may be held liable for any damages beyond normal fair wear and tear. See your ADL or UH Management Office representative if you have any questions about your resident responsibilities.</p>
                <h3>Inspection Program</h3>
                <p>The Installation Commander establishes a base-wide UH inspection program focused on health and safety. Squadron Commanders and unit First Sergeants implement the inspection program and visit rooms to ensure that all residents from their squadron comply with installation standards.</p>
                <h3>Bay Orderly Program</h3>
                <p>UH residents are expected to assist in the cleaning and upkeep of common areas and shared facilities of their "home." You will periodically be detailed to perform essential cleaning and minor maintenance around the UH campus.</p>
                <h3>Dormitory Councils</h3>
                <p>The Airmen Dormitory Council is the forum by which residents of an individual dormitory or group of dormitories address concerns about their living environment with a panel of their peers. The purpose of the council is to establish standards for all residents, present solutions for problem areas, establish positive recreational activities and identify facility and furnishing improvements. Participation at your location is a chance to be involved in shaping your living environment and provides an opportunity for personal growth and development in the areas of leadership and personal relationships. Ask your ADL or UH Management Office representative about how you can get involved.</p>
                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>It is mandatory for unaccompanied Airmen in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service to reside in UH. An E-4 residing in UH reaching 3 years of service may be authorized to move out of UH and into local community housing. Contact the UH Management Office for procedures you must follow to clear your room. In certain circumstances, such as to make space available for more junior Airmen, you may be authorized to move out of UH before reaching E-4 with greater than 3 years of service. The most senior Airmen are released first. Your ADL or UH Management Office representative will advise residents when early release is necessary.</p>
                <h3>Space Available Rooms</h3>
                <p>When there is an excess of dormitory rooms, personnel in the ranks of E-4 with greater than 3 years of service and above may be eligible to reside in UH on a space available basis. Contact the UH Management Office to inquire about availability.</p>
