                <h2 class="header">Unaccompanied Housing</h2>
                <p id="heat-statement">At Aviano AB, we strive to create an inclusive environment that cultivates the development and training of Airmen. The Air Force recognizes that the management of Unaccompanied Housing (UH) facilities is critical to an Airman's development process. UH is a personal residence and we strive to provide a modern, functional, well maintained and comfortable home, as well as promote pride, professionalism and personal dignity.<br><br>UH is provided for unaccompanied Airmen in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service. Each Airman is provided a private sleeping room, furnishings, bed linens and supplies required for comfortable living. (Room arrangements may vary depending on location).<br><br>Unaccompanied Airmen in the rank of E-4 with 3 years of service and above will move into housing in the local community. Please refer to the Housing in the Local Community section for information and assistance on securing housing.</p>
                <h3>UH Campus</h3>
                <p>The main dormitory campus is located near the flight line (Area F). This campus is located near the dining facility, Base Exchange, commissary, mass briefing facility (Movie Theater), La Bella Vista Club, fitness center and the Airman and Family Readiness Center. The campus consists of seven dorms built since 2002. Six dorms have 102 rooms all designed to the 1+1 standard (room-bath-room configuration).<br><br>A seventh dorm that was opened Jan, 2014 is the new 'Quad' or 'Dorms for Airmen (D4A)' configuration. This dorm houses 144 Airmen in a 4+1 configuration where each room has their own bathroom and 4 rooms share a kitchen, living room, and laundry facility.</p>
                <h3>Base Specific Policies and Restrictions</h3>
                <p>During your orientation, the Airman Dorm Leader (ADL) or UH Management Office representative will inform you of all Air Force and base-specific policies and restrictions or you may refer to the Unaccompanied Housing Brochure found in Important Links.</p>
                <h3>UH Management Office Staff</h3>
                <p>The UH Management Office is staffed with housing professionals that can assist with all of your housing needs. Staffs vary but are highly motivated personnel dedicated to ensuring that you receive quality service. ADLs will provide you guidance and advice on UH life as well as mentor you on succeeding in the Air Force.</p>
                <h3>Assignment Procedures</h3>
                <p>As soon as you are notified of your assignment contact your gaining unit and request to be assigned a sponsor. Your sponsor will be another military member assigned to your unit and will assist with your move. The sponsor or gaining unit must then contact the UH Management Office to notify them of your impending arrival date and work to secure you a dormitory room.</p>
                <h3>Unit Integrity</h3>
                <p>In most cases, you will be assigned a room in an area of the dormitory set aside for the personnel who work in your unit. This is to promote camaraderie among squadron members. If a room is not available near other members of your unit, you may be assigned a temporary room until one with your unit becomes available.</p>
                <h3>Planning Your Move</h3>
                <p>Prior to travel, arrange to meet your sponsor or someone from your unit upon arrival at the gaining installation. If you arrive on a business day during normal duty hours, have your sponsor escort you to the UH Management Office. An ADL or a civilian Dorm Manager will take you through the process of checking you into your room and performing a move-in inspection and inventory of the allotted furnishings and supplies.<br><br>If you arrive on the weekend or after normal duty hours, have your sponsor make arrangements to pick up your room key from the UH Management Office or acquire a hospitality room for you until you can meet with an ADL or Dorm Manager. If you obtain your room key outside of normal duty hours, it is still a mandatory requirement to report to the UH Management Office the next duty day for in-processing.</p>
                <h3>Vehicle Shipping</h3>
                <p>Ship your personally owned vehicle (POV) 6-8 weeks before your departure. Since Aviano Air Base facilities are located in several different areas, you will be required to do business in different locations and a POV will be very important to you. It is better to ship early and rent in the US as opposed to renting in Italy. If you decide to rent a vehicle at Aviano, a stateside AAA International license is required.</p>
                <h3>Airman and Family Readiness Center (AFRC)</h3>
                <p>Ship your personally owned vehicle (POV) 6-8 weeks before your departure. Since Aviano Air Base facilities are located in several different areas, you will be required to do business in different locations and a POV will be very important to you. It is better to ship early and rent in the US as opposed to renting in Italy. If you decide to rent a vehicle at Aviano, a stateside AAA International license is required.</p>
                <h3>Airman and Family Readiness Center (AFRC)</h3>
                <p>The local AFRC is a great resource to obtain pertinent information about the area.<br><br>Bldg. 1431, Flightline Phone: 011-39-0434-30-5407 or DSN 314-632-5407</p>
                <h3>Resident Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>You will be expected to keep your room and any shared living space clean and tidy. Cleaning supplies and equipment can be provided to you free of charge. You will also be accountable for your room and the furnishings provided. Residents may be held liable for any damages beyond normal fair wear and tear. See your ADL or UH Management Office representative if you have any questions about your resident responsibilities.</p>
                <h3>Inspection Program</h3>
                <p>The Installation Commander establishes a base-wide UH inspection program focused on health and safety. Squadron Commanders and unit First Sergeants implement the inspection program and visit rooms to ensure that all residents from their squadron comply with installation standards.</p>
                <h3>Bay Orderly Program</h3>
                <p>UH residents are expected to assist in the cleaning and upkeep of common areas and shared facilities of their 'home.' You will periodically be detailed to perform essential cleaning and minor maintenance around the UH campus.</p>
                <h3>Dormitory Councils</h3>
                <p>The Airmen Dormitory Council is the forum by which residents of an individual dormitory or group of dormitories address concerns about their living environment with a panel of their peers. The purpose of the council is to establish standards for all residents, present solutions for problem areas, establish positive recreational activities and identify facility and furnishing improvements. Participation at your location is a chance to be involved in shaping your living environment and provides an opportunity for personal growth and development in the areas of leadership and personal relationships. Ask your ADL or UH Management Office representative about how you can get involved.</p>
                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>It is mandatory for unaccompanied Airmen in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service to reside in UH. An E-4 residing in UH reaching 3 years of service may be authorized to move out of UH and into local community housing. Contact the UH Management Office for procedures you must follow to clear your room. In certain circumstances, such as to make space available for more junior Airmen, you may be authorized to move out of UH before reaching E-4 with greater than 3 years of service. The most senior Airmen are released first.</p>

                <h2 class="header">Community Housing</h2>
                <h3>Housing in the Local Community</h3>
                <p id="faq-information">The MIlitary Housing Office (MHO) provides all DoD personnel with personalized service to assist in locating suitable housing in your new host country. Moving to a new country can often be confusing and stressful; however, it can also be exciting. Living off base provides members and families the chance to experience a new culture and make friends with their host country neighbors. The MHO will assist you every step of the way to help you find your new home in the local community.</p>
                <h3>Housing Services</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving. The government housing team will provide you the latest information on the local housing situation as well as local laws governing off-base housing. The MHO partners with landlords, realtors and property managers to make sure you receive the most current information about the local housing market.<br><br>The MHO can assist you by providing translation services to establish appointments to view available units,negotiating lease contracts,assisting in establishing utility services, and providing furnishings support. See Furnishings Management for a list temporary loaner and tour duration items available.<br><br>Your sponsor is the key to successful house hunting by providing their local area knowledge and in some cases, transportation. GPS devices are made available on a first-come-first-serve basis through the MHO and Airman and Family Readiness Center. These instruments are normally checked out for a period of 24 hours. After you move into your home, the MHO is available for on-going assistance with translation services should you need to communicate with your landlord.</p>
                <h3>Community Housing</h3>
                <p>Housing in Italy is definitely different than in the United States. The Housing Office continues to work with local landlords to include typical American-style amenities such as air conditioning, light fixtures, adequate kitchen counter and storage space, off-street parking, and window screens.</p>
                <h3>Minimum Adequacy Standards</h3>
                <p>The Housing Office inspects all community housing to ensure it meets minimum adequacy standards and is considered suitable for Aviano member occupancy. If any deficiencies are noted, the landlord will be given the opportunity to correct them. If, however, all deficiencies are not corrected, the unit will not be deemed acceptable and cannot be listed.</p>
                <h3>Rental Amount</h3>
                <p>In accordance with AF policy, the Housing Office will not approve a lease if the rental amount is deemed excessive.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>While personal property insurance is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged. You should obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle.<br><br>There are several types of insurance (personal property, liability, pet insurance and legal representation) members may purchase to protect their property and tenant rights. We strongly recommend you consider purchasing commercial insurance to protect yourself in case of fire or other major loss. A common policy for this type of coverage would be renter's liability insurance which would cover your personal property and damages to your rental home.</p>
                <h3>Realtor Services</h3>
                <p>In Aviano, if you choose to use realtor services, discuss fees up front, as some realtors charge a finder's fee and government reimbursement is not authorized.</p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>
                <p>Visit the Aviano Elementary School and Aviano Middle/High School websites for detailed information about schools, the DODDS System and Bus Service at Aviano.</p>
