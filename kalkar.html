                <h2 class="header">Community Housing</h2>
                <h3>Housing in the Local Community</h3>
                <p id="faq-information">The Military Housing Office (MHO) provides all DoD personnel with a personalized service to assist in locating suitable housing in your new host country. Moving to a new country can often be confusing and stressful; however, it can also be exciting. Living off base provides members and families the chance to experience a new culture and make friends with their host country neighbors. The MHO will assist you every step of the way to help you find your new home in the local community.</p>
                <h3>Housing Services</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving. The MHO partners with landlords, realtors and property managers to make sure you receive the most current information about the local housing market.<br><br>The MHO can assist you by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing translation services to establish appointments to view available units</li>
                    <li>Negotiating lease contracts</li>
                    <li>Providing furnishings support. See Furnishings Management for a list of the Duration of Tour Items available.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your sponsor will assist you in house hunting at this location.<br><br>After you move into your home, the MHO is available for on-going assistance with translation services should you need to communicate with your landlord.</p>
                <h3>Community Housing Units</h3>
                <p>The MHO provides up-to-date listings of available economy units, translation services, and landlord/tenant mediation.<br><br>Economy housing for large families may require a diligent search and you may have to stay in temporary lodging for 4 weeks or longer.<br><br>For information about the housing allowances that financially support your move, see Referral and Relocation Assistance.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle.<br><br>Before purchasing your insurance, please consult the MHO for more information about coverage.</p>
                <h3>Realtor Services</h3>
                <p>The use of local realtor services is typically unnecessary and is not recommended unless a home for rent is only listed with a specific realtor. In OCONUS, if you choose to use realtor services, discuss fees up front, as some realtors charge a finder's fee and government reimbursement is rarely authorized. To request government reimbursement for realtor services in OCONUS, you must submit a request for authorization through the HMO before signing a lease or contract. In CONUS, fees for realtor services are not reimbursable.</p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>
                <p>For families, we understand that where your children attend school plays a large factor in the decision of where to live.<br><br>At Kalkar parents have three basic options for schooling: private English-speaking schools, local German schools and home-schooling. There are no Department of Defense Dependents School (DoDDS) schools available for Kalkar dependent students.<br><br>Most students from the US community attend the International School of Dusseldorf (ISD) for grades K - 12 or the British school St. George in Duisburg. Registration and tuition fees for qualified dependents are paid by the Non-DoD School Program (NDSP).<br><br>For more information about schools, visit the following helpful websites:</p>
