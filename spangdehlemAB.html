                <h2 class="header">Government Housing</h2>
                <p id="getting-started-statement">For many families, living in government housing provides easy access to a wealth of community services and amenities such as schools, youth programs, Commissary/Exchange, and food services. This is especially true in overseas locations where you will find yourself dependent on the support facilities and services on the installation much more than those in the U.S. Living within government housing provides a safe and secure place to reside and provides a mentoring and supportive environment for families. Government housing is provided to military members who meet the appropriate criteria. This includes: - Members with dependents authorized to reside with them - Military-Married-to-Military couples assigned to same or adjacent base and reside jointly Contact the Military Housing Office (MHO) if you have any questions about the housing eligibility criteria at this location.<br><br>Spangdahlem AB, GE Housing - 139 Townhomes - 92 Stairwell units - 2 Duplex-type units</p>
                <h3>Applying for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>If you desire to live in government housing, please submit an advance application for assignment (DD Form 1746) through the MHO at your losing installation with a complete copy of your PCS orders. The effective date of the application is the date you depart your prior installation (including members with TDY enroute) or the date ordered to active duty. Applications can also be submitted upon arrival during your first visit to the MHO. MHO staff will be able to assist in the completion of the application and will review PCS orders and housing options with you. For walk-in applications, as long as you apply for government housing within 30 days of arrival, you will be placed on the waiting list effective the date you departed from your previous installation. After 30 days, the application date will be the date of the walk-in. Please be sure your application identifies and includes supporting documentation for an impending promotion or gain of dependents so that you can be placed on the appropriate waiting list.</p>

                <h2 class="header">Unaccompanied Housing</h2>
                <p id="heat-statement">At Spangdahlem AB we strive to create an inclusive environment that cultivates the development and training of Airmen. The Air Force recognizes that the management of Unaccompanied Housing (UH) facilities is critical to an Airman's development process. UH is a personal residence and we strive to provide a modern, functional, well maintained and comfortable home, as well as promote pride, professionalism and personal dignity. UH is provided for unaccompanied Airmen in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service. Each Airman is provided a private sleeping room, furnishings, bed linens and supplies required for comfortable living. (Room arrangements may vary depending on Squadron assigned) Unaccompanied Airmen in the rank of E-4 with greater than 3 years of service and above will move into housing in the local community. Please refer to the Housing in the Local Community section for information and assistance on securing housing. The permanent party UH campus at Spangdahlem AB consists of 844 rooms in 8 different dormitories.</p>
                <h3>Amenities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>basketball</li>
                    <li>volleyball courts</li>
                    <li>pavilions with concrete patios for outdoor grilling</li>
                    <li>patio furniture</li>
                    <li>bicycle stands</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Base Specific Policy</h3>
                <p>During your orientation, the ADL or UH Management Office representative will inform you of all Air Force and base-specific policies. Base policy and Restrictions at Spangdahlem AB are outlined in the Dorm Resident Brochure.</p>
                <h3>UH Management Office Staff</h3>
                <p>The UH Management Office is staffed with professionals that can assist with all of your housing needs. Staffs vary but can be comprised of non-commissioned officers (NCO), Senior NCOs and some bases have civilian employees. The assigned military are Airman Dormitory Leaders (ADL). These members are highly motivated personnel dedicated to ensuring that residents receive quality service. ADLs will provide you guidance and advice on UH life as well as mentor you on succeeding in the Air Force.</p>
                <h3>Assignment Procedures</h3>
                <p>As soon as you are notified of your assignment, contact your gaining unit and request to be assigned a sponsor. Your sponsor will be another military member assigned to your unit and will assist with your move. The sponsor or gaining unit must then contact the UH Management Office to notify them of your impending arrival date and work to secure you a dormitory room.</p>
                <h3>Unit Integrity</h3>
                <p>In most cases, you will be assigned a room in an area of the dormitory set aside for the personnel who work in your unit. This is to promote camaraderie among squadron members. If a room is not available near other members of your unit, you may be assigned a temporary room until one with your unit becomes available.</p>
                <h3>Planning Your Move</h3>
                <p>Prior to travel, arrange to meet your sponsor or someone from your unit upon arrival at the gaining installation. If you arrive on a business day during normal duty hours, have your sponsor escort you to the UH Management Office. An ADL or a civilian Dorm Manager will take you through the process of checking you into your room and performing a move-in inspection and inventory of the allotted furnishings and supplies. If you arrive on the weekend or after normal duty hours, have your sponsor make arrangements to pick up your room key from the UH Management Office or acquire a hospitality room for you until you can meet with an ADL or Dorm Manager. If you obtain your room key outside of normal duty hours, it is still a mandatory requirement to report to the UH Management Office the next duty day for in-processing.</p>
                <h3>Resident Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>You will be expected to keep your room and any shared living space clean and tidy. Cleaning supplies and equipment can be provided to you free of charge. You will also be accountable for your room and the furnishings provided. Residents may be held liable for any damages beyond normal fair wear and tear. See your ADL or UH Management Office representative if you have any questions about your resident responsibilities.</p>
                <h3>Inspection Program</h3>
                <p>The Installation Commander establishes a base-wide UH inspection program focused on health and safety. Squadron Commanders and unit First Sergeants implement the inspection program and visit rooms to ensure that all residents from their squadron comply with installation standards.</p>
                <h3>Bay Orderly Program</h3>
                <p>UH residents are expected to assist in the cleaning and upkeep of common areas and shared facilities of their "home." You will periodically be detailed to perform essential cleaning and minor maintenance around the UH campus.</p>
                <h3>Dormitory Councils</h3>
                <p>The Airmen Dormitory Council is the forum by which residents of an individual dormitory or group of dormitories address concerns about their living environment with a panel of their peers. The purpose of the council is to establish standards for all residents, present solutions for problem areas, establish positive recreational activities and identify facility and furnishing improvements. Participation at your location is a chance to be involved in shaping your living environment and provides an opportunity for personal growth and development in the areas of leadership and personal relationships. Ask your ADL or UH Management Office representative about how you can get involved.</p>
                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>It is mandatory for unaccompanied Airmen in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service to reside in UH. An E-4 residing in UH reaching 3 years of service may be authorized to move out of UH and into local community housing. Contact the UH Management Office for procedures you must follow to clear your room. In certain circumstances, such as to make space available for more junior Airmen, you may be authorized to move out of UH before reaching E-4 with greater than 3 years of service. The most senior Airmen are released first. Your ADL or UH Management Office representative will advise residents when early release is necessary.</p>
                <h3>Space Available Rooms</h3>
                <p>When there is an excess of dormitory rooms, personnel in the ranks of E-4 with greater than 3 years of service and above may be eligible to reside in UH on a space available basis. Contact the UH Management Office to inquire about availability.</p>

The government housing team will provide you the latest information on the local housing situation as well as local laws governing off-base housing. The MHO partners with landlords and property managers to make sure you receive the most current information about the local housing market.

                    <br><br>The MHO monitors off-base rental listings to ensure that they are safe and adequate. .
                    
                    <br><br>You must report to the MHO within two work days of arrival. We are located in Building 454. Our office hours are Mon, Wed-Fri, 0800 to 1600. Tuesdays we are open 1000 to 1600.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Providing translation services to establish appointments to view available units</li>
                        <li>Negotiating lease contracts</li>
                        <li>Assisting in establishing utility services</li>
                        <li>Providing furnishings support</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>All military and DOD personnel who are authorized a housing allowance (BAH/OHA/LQA) are entitled to receive loaner furniture. Personnel are authorized a refrigerator, stove, washer, dryer, microwave, wardrobes, transformers, smoke detectors, and fire extinguisher for the duration of their tour. Temporary loaner furniture such as a couch, easy chairs, cribs, dining table, dining chairs, coffee table, double/single beds, and dresser drawers may be retained up to 90 days or until the receipt of household goods, whichever occurs first. Residents must schedule pick up of loaner items to coincide with household goods delivery or immediately thereafter. Contact the Furnishings Management Office at DSN 452-6802.</p>
                <h3>Spangdahlem AB Housing Economy Agents</h3>
                <p>There are five economy (off-base housing referral) agents available to assist you. Each agent is a Spangdahlem AB employee and services a certain geographical area. It is important to make an appointment to see an agent as they are often out of the office acquiring or inspecting economy listings. They may be reached at 452-7133.

                    <br><br>Your sponsor should be your first line of support for transportation. We recommend personnel take the German Driving Test as soon as possible. Click Here for the manual. Also, ship your car as soon as possible. Rental cars can be expensive in Germany. Housing Referral agents can take you and your family to view listings by appointment only.
                    
                    <br><br>After you move into your home, the MHO is available for on-going assistance with translation services should you need to communicate with your landlord.</p>
                <h3>Community Housing Units</h3>
                <p>The MHO provides up-to-date listings of available economy units, translation services, and landlord/tenant mediation. German homes are very different from US homes. They are constructed of cinder-blocks and require daily airing. Otherwise, mold could form within the home and you could be held liable. Additionally, there are few stand-alone homes. Many homes contain two or three apartments under one roof. The landlords may live in one apartment and tenants in the other(s). Many older homes have recently been completely renovated and modern homes have recently been constructed. Generally speaking, 2/3/4 homes are available on any given day.

                    <br><br>For information about the housing allowances that financially support your move, see Referral and Relocation Assistance or visit the Defense Travel Management Office website.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle. Before purchasing your insurance, please consult the MHO for more information about coverage.</p>
                <h3>Realtor Services</h3>
                <p>The use of German realtor services is discouraged because German leases are utilized. German leases require 90 days termination notice and 3 months' rent for security deposit. Additionally, the burden of change of occupancy maintenance is on the tenant, not the landlord. That means, you could be held responsible for all or a portion of the preparation for the next tenant when you terminate the lease.

                    <br><br>The MHO uses the USAFE sanctioned lease which benefits the military. The MHO ensures the government pays fair market value and the MHO can mediate on the tenant's behalf in case of a dispute. With a German lease, neither the MHO nor Base Legal can mediate for the tenant.</p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>
                <p>For families, we understand that where your children attend school plays a large factor in the decision of where to live.
