                <h2 class="header">Privatized Housing</h2>
                <p id="getting-started-statement">At Edwards AFB, family housing is privatized. Mayroad owns the family housing and is responsible for maintaining, repairing, constructing and managing the community. In addition to your option to purchase and rent housing in the local community, you now may choose to live in privatized housing by signing a tenant lease agreement with Mayroad Military Living. Housing inventory consists of 741 homes; 581 for enlisted members and 160 for officers.<br><br>For comprehensive information about the privatized housing community at Edwards AFB, visit the Mayroad website. The website provides information you need to know about the homes and amenities available in the privatized housing community.</p>
                <h3>Applying for Mayroad</h3>
                <p>Contact Mayroad as soon as you know you are moving to Edwards AFB. The Mayroad team will provide you the latest information about privatized housing and details about the application process.</p>
                <h3>Community Amenities</h3>
                <p>Privatized housing is comparable to housing in the local community and provides a wide variety of amenities and support services.<br><br>Community features such as walking paths, playgrounds, parks, picnic areas, basketball, volley ball and tennis courts, covered pavilions with BBG grills, lawn maintenance and various resident activities are just some of the amenities you will find at Edwards AFB.</p>
                <h3>Paying Rent for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Similar to living in the local community, you will sign a tenant lease agreement, typically for a one-year term. Your lease includes a military clause and a lease termination clause. You pay your monthly rent by authorizing an allotment of your BAH that is paid directly to Mayroad. If your move occurs prior to the allotment start date, then you will need to pay the pro-rated rent directly to Mayroad. The Tenant Lease Agreement spells out all relevant rent payment terms and conditions.</p>
                <h3>Gas and Electric Utilities</h3>
                <p>At this location, homes in the base housing community are individually metered.  The utilities are managed by ConService who collects the utility usage, calculates the average consumption of occupied “like homes” on the installation and provides direct billing to the residents.<br><br>The average monthly baseline is covered by the utility component of your BAH and included in your rent.  If your monthly utilization exceeds the average you will be billed; however, if your utilization is less than the average you will receive a rebate.  The more energy you conserve the more money you keep in your pocket.  Water, trash, and sewer are included in your rent at no extra charge.  For additional information about utilities, contact Mayroad at 661 385-6060.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You should obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle.<br><br>California law requires that the building owner carry insurance on the dwelling that is being rented; this doesn't cover any of your belongings inside the home. Renters insurance, also known as tenant's insurance, provides protection for items in your home as well as liability protection in the event that someone is injured at your home. Before purchasing your insurance, please consult Mayroad for more information about coverage.</p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>
                <p>For kindergarten through 6th grade, students attend Irving L Branch Elementary School on base; for 7th through 12th grade, students will attend Desert Junior Senior High School. Both schools are public schools located on Edwards AFB and fall under the Muroc Joint Unified School District. Edwards AFB has a School Liaison Officer who is the central point of contact for school related matters working directly with base leadership, families, school districts, and local communities and can be contacted at (661) 277-3210.</p>
