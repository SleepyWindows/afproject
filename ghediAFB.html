                <p id="faq-information">The Military Housing Office (MHO) provides all DoD personnel with a personalized service to assist in locating suitable housing in your new host country.

The MHO partners with landlords and property managers to make sure you receive the most current information about the local housing market. The MHO monitors off-base rental listings to ensure that they are safe and adequate. The MHO can assist you by:</p>

                <p>The MHO provides up-to-date listings of available economy units, translation services, and landlord/tenant mediation.<br><br>Housing in Italy varies in size and style from what you are used to and units do not come equipped with what Americans expect to be standard amenities, such as closets, light fixtures and kitchen cabinets. The Furnishings Management Section in Vicenza will assist you with the temporary loaner furnishings and major appliances you may need during your tour. For more information, see Furnishings Management linked in the Important Links section of this page.<br><br>For information about the housing allowances that financially support your move, see Referral and Relocation Assistance.</p>

                <h3>Realtor Services</h3>
                <p>In Italy, Realtors' fees are the equivalent of one month rent plus 20% tax. This fee is not refundable by the Government and therefore the member will have to pay out of pocket.</p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>
                <p>For families, we understand that where your children attend school plays a large factor in the decision of where to live.<br><br>Please contact the DoDD's school representative at DSN 632-3533 to get more information on school options and school bus routes.
