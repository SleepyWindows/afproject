                <h2 class="header">Privatized Housing</h2>
                <p id="getting-started-statement">At Schriever SFB, military family housing is privatized. Tierra Vista Communities owns the family housing and is responsible for maintaining, repairing, constructing and managing the community. In addition to your option to purchase and rent housing in the local community, you now may choose to live in privatized housing by signing a tenant lease agreement with Tierra Vista Communities.<br><br>For comprehensive information about the privatized housing community at Schriever SFB, visit the Tierra Vista Communities website. The website provides information you need to know about the homes and amenities available in the privatized housing community.</p>
                <h3>Applying for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving to Schriever SFB. The government housing team will provide you the latest information about privatized housing and details about the application process. The MHO will also update you on any base specific policies regarding residing in privatized housing.</p>
                <h3>Community Amenities</h3>
                <p>Privatized housing is comparable to housing in the local community and provides a wide variety of amenities and support services.

                    <br><br>Community features such as the community center with a covered, heated pool, splash park, playgrounds, baseball and soccer field, basketball court, volleyball pits and walking trails are just some of the amenities you will find at Tierra Vista Communities.
                    
                    <br><br>As a resident of privatized housing, contact the Property Management Office to obtain more specific information on the services available at your location.
                    </p>
                <h3>Paying Rent for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Similar to living in the local community, you will sign a tenant lease agreement, typically for a one-year term. Your lease includes a military clause and a lease termination clause. You pay your monthly rent by authorizing an allotment of your BAH that is paid directly to the Property Manager. If your move occurs prior to the allotment start date, then you will need to pay the pro-rated rent directly to the Property Manager. The Tenant Lease Agreement spells out all relevant rent payment terms and conditions.</p>
                <h3>Gas and Electric Utilities</h3>
                <p>At this location, homes in the community are metered and you will be billed directly for gas and electric. Tierra Vista Communities, on behalf of the local utility provider, utilizes a third party company (MINOL) to manage and collect your utility bill based on personal consumption. Since the homes are metered, you will retain a portion of the BAH to pay the utilities directly. The utility allowance is determined based on 110 percent of the estimated average utility cost (gas and electric) for each unit type. The more energy you conserve, the more money you keep in your pocket! For more information about your utilities, please contact the Property Management Office.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle. TVC Renter's Insurance information can be found under Featured Documents.

                    <br><br>Before purchasing your insurance, please consult the Property Management Office for more information about coverage.

                <h3>Housing in the Local Community</h3>
                <p id="faq-information">The Military Housing Office (MHO) provides all DoD personnel with personalized services to assist in locating suitable housing in the local community. Although moving is sometimes stressful, it can also be an exciting opportunity to live off base and experience a new location. The MHO will assist you every step of the way to help you find your new home in the local community.</p>
                <h3>Housing Services</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving. The government housing team will provide you the latest information on the local housing situation and offer complete referral services and relocation assistance to make sure you find a quality place to live.

                    <br><br>Support services range from helping members understand their lease agreements and the necessity for a military release clause to assisting in resident and landlord dispute resolution, among many others.
                    
                    <br><br>The MHO partners with landlords, realtors and property managers to make sure you receive the most current information about the local housing market. The MHO also monitors housing units offered for rent to the military community.
                    </p>
                <h3>Community Housing Units</h3>
                <p>There are a few things that you need to consider before renting. First, make sure you are not renting from anyone that may be on the Military Off-Limits Establishment List. Second, when renting a property you need to make sure that you have a Military Clause in your contract, this is because if you are deployed or you may be reassigned out of the local area that you would be able to get out of your current contract.

                    <br><br>If you are looking for sales information, check out Pikes Peak Association of Realtors. This is a great site that can help you get started in your home buying adventure.  We cannot recommend any individual or companies because we are regulated by law, but as a general rule if you keep with the well know companies you'll find that your process will go a lot smoother. Family Support provides a quarterly Home Buyer Seminar where a realtor and a loan company agent come in and provide basic information on the home buying process. One of the first things you will need to do is to get yourself pre-qualified to let you know what you can afford. Also, remember that the home buying process could be very time consuming, and in some cases it takes months.
                    
                    <br><br>You may also want to do a search for crimes in the area that you are looking to rent or buy (Local Police Departments have that type of information available). Finally, be very careful about renting or buying any property before seeing it first.
