                <h2 class="header">Privatized Housing</h2>
                <p id="getting-started-statement">For many families, living in government housing provides easy access to a wealth of community services and amenities such as schools, youth programs, Commissary/Exchange, and food services. This is especially true in overseas locations where you will find yourself dependent on the support facilities and services on the installation much more than those in the U.S. Living within government housing provides a safe and secure place to reside and provides a mentoring and supportive environment for families.<br><br>Government housing is provided to military members who meet the appropriate criteria.<br><br>This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Members with dependents authorized to reside with them</li>
                    <li>Military-Married-to-Military couples assigned to same or adjacent base and reside jointly</li>
                    <li>Eligible Department of the Air Force civilian employees are authorized to apply for and occupy government-controlled housing in all areas on a space-available basis, which will not normally exceed five years without prior approval of the installation commander.</li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you desire to live in government housing, please submit an advance application for assignment (DD Form 1746) through the MHO at your losing installation with a complete copy of your PCS orders. The effective date of the application is the date you depart your prior installation (including members with TDY enroute) or the date ordered to active duty.<br><br>Applications can also be submitted upon arrival during your first visit to the MHO. MHO staff will be able to assist in the completion of the application and will review PCS orders and housing options with you. For walk-in applications, as long as you apply for government housing within 30 days of arrival, you will be placed on the waiting list effective the date you departed from your previous installation. After 30 days, the application date will be the date of the walk-in.<br><br>Please be sure your application identifies and includes supporting documentation for an impending promotion or gain of dependents so that you can be placed on the appropriate waiting list.</p>

                <h2 class="header">Unaccompanied Housing</h2>
                <p id="heat-statement">At RAF Croughton we strive to create an inclusive environment that cultivates the development and training of Airmen. The Air Force recognizes that the management of Unaccompanied Housing (UH) facilities is critical to an Airman's development process. UH is a personal residence and we strive to provide a modern, functional, well maintained and comfortable home, as well as promote pride, professionalism and personal dignity.

                    <br><br>UH is provided for unaccompanied Airmen in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service. Each Airman is provided a private sleeping room, furnishings, bed linens and supplies required for comfortable living. (Room arrangements may vary depending on location)
                    
                    <br><br>Unaccompanied Airmen in the rank of E-4 with greater than three years of service and above will move into housing in the local community. Please refer to the Housing in the Local Community section for information and assistance on securing housing.
                    
                    <br><br>The permanent party UH campus at RAF Croughton consists of 1 1/2 dormitory buildings with two-room, fully-furnished dormitory suites (each member occupies one room), connected by a shared kitchen and bathroom and separated by heavy doors. Each room has a walk-in closet and wash hand basin with full mirror. The kitchen is full size with all appliances. The bathrooms have either a walk-in shower or bath tub with shower.
                    </p>
                <h3>Amenities</h3>

                </ul>
                <h3>Base Specific Policy</h3>
                <p>During your orientation, the ADL or UH Management Office representative will inform you of all Air Force and base-specific policies.</p>
                <h3>UH Management Office Staff</h3>
                <p>The UH Management Office is staffed with professionals that can assist with all of your housing needs. Staffs vary but are currently comprised of civilian employees. These members are highly motivated personnel dedicated to ensuring that residents receive quality service. Staff will provide you guidance and advice on UH life.</p>
                <h3>Assignment Procedures</h3>
                <p>As soon as you are notified of your assignment, contact your gaining unit and request to be assigned a sponsor. Your sponsor will be another military member assigned to your unit and will assist with your move. The sponsor or gaining unit must then contact the UH Management Office to notify them of your impending arrival date and work to secure you a dormitory room.</p>
                <h3>Unit Integrity</h3>
                <p>In most cases, you will be assigned a room in an area of the dormitory set aside for the personnel who work in your unit. This is to promote camaraderie among squadron members. If a room is not available near other members of your unit, you may be assigned a temporary room until one with your unit becomes available.</p>
                <h3>Planning Your Move</h3>
                <p>Prior to travel, arrange to meet your sponsor or someone from your unit upon arrival at the gaining installation.<br><br>If you arrive on a business day during normal duty hours, have your sponsor escort you to the UH Management Office. An ADL or a civilian Dorm Manager will take you through the process of checking you into your room and performing a move-in inspection and inventory of the allotted furnishings and supplies.<br><br>If you arrive on the weekend or after normal duty hours, have your sponsor make arrangements to pick up your room key from the UH Management Office or acquire a hospitality room for you until you can meet with an ADL or Dorm Manager.<br><br>If you obtain your room key outside of normal duty hours, it is still a mandatory requirement to report to the UH Management Office the next duty day for in-processing.<br><br>If you plan on driving in the U.K., ensure you have a valid state-issued driver's license before you PCS; you'll need this to obtain a 3rd AF driving permit.</p>
                <h3>Resident Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>You will be expected to keep your room and any shared living space clean and tidy. Cleaning supplies and equipment can be provided to you free of charge. You will also be accountable for your room and the furnishings provided. Residents may be held liable for any damages beyond normal fair wear and tear.<br><br>See your ADL or UH Management Office representative if you have any questions about your resident responsibilities.</p>
                <h3>Inspection Program</h3>
                <p>The Installation Commander establishes a base-wide UH inspection program focused on health and safety. Squadron Commanders and unit First Sergeants implement the inspection program and visit rooms to ensure that all residents from their squadron comply with installation standards.</p>
                <h3>Bay Orderly Program</h3>
                <p>UH residents are expected to assist in the cleaning and upkeep of common areas and shared facilities of their "home." You will periodically be detailed to perform essential cleaning and minor maintenance around the UH campus.</p>
                <h3>Dormitory Councils</h3>
                <p>The Airmen Dormitory Council is the forum by which residents of an individual dormitory or group of dormitories address concerns about their living environment with a panel of their peers. The purpose of the council is to establish standards for all residents, present solutions for problem areas, establish positive recreational activities and identify facility and furnishing improvements. Participation at your location is a chance to be involved in shaping your living environment and provides an opportunity for personal growth and development in the areas of leadership and personal relationships.<br><br>Ask your ADL or UH Management Office representative about how you can get involved.</p>
                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>It is mandatory for unaccompanied Airmen in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service to reside in UH. An E-4 residing in UH reaching 3 years of service may be authorized to move out of UH and into local community housing. Contact the UH Management Office for procedures you must follow to clear your room. In certain circumstances, such as to make space available for more junior Airmen, you may be authorized to move out of UH before reaching E-4 with greater than 3 years of service. The most senior Airmen are released first. Your ADL or UH Management Office representative will advise residents when early release is necessary.</p>
                <h3>Space Available Rooms</h3>
                <p>When there is an excess of dormitory rooms, personnel in the ranks of E-4 with greater than 3 years of service and above may be eligible to reside in UH on a space available basis.<br><br>Contact the UH Management Office to inquire about availability.</p>

                <h2 class="header">Community Housing</h2>
                <h3>Housing in the Local Community</h3>
                <p id="faq-information">Housing in the Local Community The Military Housing Office (MHO) provides all DoD personnel with a personalized service to assist in locating suitable housing in your new host country. Moving to a new country can often be confusing and stressful; however, it can also be exciting. Living off base provides members and families the chance to experience a new culture and make friends with their host country neighbors. The MHO will assist you every step of the way to help you find your new home in the local community. </p>
                <h3>Housing Services</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving. The government housing team will provide you the latest information on the local housing situation as well as local laws governing off-base housing. The MHO partners with landlords, realtors and property managers to make sure you receive the most current information about the local housing market. We recommend you begin your housing search area within 20 miles of "Croughton, Brackley, Northamptonshire". The MHO monitors off-base rental listings to ensure that they are safe and adequate. If you find available units you are interested in you must wait until you arrive to secure housing so that you can tour the prospective units and surrounding area. The MHO must ensure that your tenancy agreement (lease) includes the U.S. military clause provided by 3rd Air Force in the U.K. This clause must be included for you to receive the Overseas Housing Allowance. The MHO can assist you by: - Briefing members and giving advice - Negotiating lease contracts - Providing furnishings support. See Furnishings Management for a list of the Duration of Tour Items available - Mediating in a matter of dispute - Investigating complaints by landlord and tenant - Providing GPS/SatNav devices for check-out during your housing search - Making sure transportation is available for members to view and inspect community housing, as required, when no public transportation is available (foreign OCONUS) - Allowing you use of an MHO laptop (not connected to DoD server) and phone, which are located at MHO, to use in your housing search After you move into your home, the MHO is available for on-going assistance with any problems and issues you may have with your letting agent or landlord, as well as reviewing renewals of your tenancy agreement and assisting you with the process again if you move to a different property.</p>
                <h3>Community Housing Units</h3>
                <p>The MHO provides up-to-date listings of available economy units and landlord/tenant mediation. Community housing within the Croughton commuting area is good. You should be able to secure and move into an adequate house within 30 days of arrival. Please keep in mind that houses in the UK are generally smaller than ones in the U.S. and the rooms are much smaller. As such, we recommend you do not bring oversized, bulky furniture and items like (American) king-size beds. Generally houses in the UK do not have central heat and air. You will find that most houses, however, are heated by radiators. Most landlords/letting agents require you to make your monthly payments by direct deposit/automatic payment from your banking institution. You will need to set up a pound account at the Community Bank at RAF Croughton soon after you arrive in order to do this. While some landlords rent directly to military members at RAF Croughton, most are facilitated through a letting agent. Estate agents will charge you fees for their services, which range from £100 to £300. All letting agent fees will be reimbursable. For information about the housing allowances that financially support your move, see Referral and Relocation Assistance.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance (contents or renter's insurance) for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle. Before purchasing your insurance, please consult the MHO for more information about coverage.</p>
                <h3>Realtor Services </h3>
                <p>The use of local realtor services is typically unnecessary and is not recommended unless a home for rent is only listed with a specific realtor. In OCONUS, if you choose to use realtor services, discuss fees up front, as some realtors charge a finder's fee and government reimbursement is rarely authorized. To request government reimbursement for realtor services in OCONUS, you must submit a request for authorization through the MHO before signing a lease or contract. In CONUS, fees for realtor services are not reimbursable.</p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>
                <p>For families, we understand that where your children attend school plays a large factor in the decision of where to live. RAF Croughton School Options are as follows: Grades K-6: Students in Kindergarten through 6th grade are fortunate to have DoDDS Croughton Elementary School on the RAF Croughton base. Families may choose to enroll their primary school age children in local British schools, but will not be reimbursed for any expenses.
