                <h3>Unit Integrity</h3>
                <p>To promote camaraderie among squadron members, you will be assigned a room in a dormitory area set aside for personnel who work in your unit, in most cases. If a room is not available near your unit, you may be assigned a temporary room until one with your unit becomes available.</p>
                <h3>Planning Your Move</h3>
                <p>Prior to travel, arrange to meet your sponsor or someone from your unit upon arrival at Eielson.<br><br>If you arrive on a business day during normal duty hours, have your sponsor escort you to the UH Management Office. An ADL or a civilian Dorm Manager will check you into your room and perform a move-in inspection and inventory of the allotted furnishings and supplies.<br><br>If you arrive on a weekend or after normal duty hours, have your sponsor make arrangements to pick up your room key from the UH Management Office or to acquire a hospitality room for you until you can meet with an ADL or Dorm Manager.<br><br>If you obtain your room key outside of normal duty hours, it is still a mandatory requirement to report to the UH Management Office the next duty day for in-processing.<br><br>Please provide a copy of orders to your sponsor or to the UH Management Office prior to arrival. Sponsor must present orders to obtain a room key for incoming personnel.</p>
                <h3>Resident Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>You will be expected to keep your room and any shared living space clean and tidy. Cleaning supplies and equipment are provided free of charge. You will also be accountable for your room and the furnishings, and may be held liable for damages beyond normal fair wear and tear.

                <h3>Inspection Program</h3>
                <p>The Installation Commander establishes a base-wide UH inspection program focused on health and safety. Squadron Commanders and unit First Sergeants implement the inspection program and visit rooms to ensure that all residents from their squadron comply with installation standards.</p>
                <h3>Bay Orderly Program</h3>
                <p>UH residents are expected to assist in the cleaning and upkeep of common areas and shared facilities of their campus "home." Periodically, you will be detailed to perform essential cleaning and minor maintenance around the UH campus.</p>
                <h3>Dormitory Councils</h3>
                <p>The Airmen Dormitory Council is the forum by which residents of an individual dormitory or group of dormitories address concerns about their living environment with a panel of their peers. The purpose of the council is to establish standards for all residents, present solutions for problem areas, establish positive recreational activities and identify facility and furnishing improvements. Participation in the Council at your location is an opportunity to be involved in shaping your living environment and for personal growth and development in leadership and personal relationships. Ask your ADL or UH Management Office representative about how you can get involved.</p>
                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>It is mandatory for unaccompanied Airmen E-1 to E-4 to reside in UH at Eielson. E-4s residing in UH may be authorized to move out of UH and into local community housing if they have placed their name on the wait list and the occupancy rate is above 95%. The UH Management Office will advise you of the procedures to clear your room. In certain circumstances, such as to make space available for more junior Airmen, some personnel may be authorized to move out of UH during their tour at Eielson. The most senior Airmen are released first if they are not within 6 months of DEROS. Your ADL or UH Management Office representative will advise residents when early release is necessary.</p>
                <h3>Space Available Rooms</h3>
                <p>Because Eielson AFB is a constrained location, all Unaccompanied Airmen E-4 and below are required to reside in UH until they are within 30 days of pinning on SSgt, or getting married. E-4s are authorized to live off base on a case-by-case basis, if the overall occupancy rate is above 95 percent. For more information, contact the UH Management Office.</p>
