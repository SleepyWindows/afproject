                <h2 class="header">Privatized Housing</h2>
                <p id="getting-started-statement">At MacDill, military family housing is privatized. Harbor Bay owns the family housing and is responsible for maintaining, repairing, constructing and managing the community. In addition to your option to purchase and rent housing in the local community, you now may choose to live in privatized housing by signing a tenant lease agreement with Harbor Bay.<br><br>For comprehensive information about the privatized housing community at MacDill, go to Harbor Bay at MacDill AFB. The website provides information you need about the homes and amenities available in the privatized housing community.</p>
                <h3>Applying for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Contact the HMO as soon as you know you are moving to MacDill. The government housing team will provide you the latest information about privatized housing and details about the application process. The HMO will also update you on any base specific policies regarding residing in privatized housing.</p>
                <h3>Community Amenities</h3>
                <p>Privatized housing is comparable to housing in the local community and provides a wide variety of amenities and support services, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Welcome Center</li>
                    <li>24-hour fitness center</li>
                    <li>Swimming pool</li>
                    <li>Running trails</li>
                    <li>Playgrounds</li>
                    <li>Golf</li>
                    <li>Bowling</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As a resident of privatized housing, contact the Property Management Office to obtain more specific information on the services available at your location.</p>
                <h3>Paying Rent for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Similar to living in the local community, you will sign a tenant lease agreement, typically for a one-year term. Your lease includes a military clause and a lease termination clause. You pay your monthly rent by authorizing an allotment of your BAH that is paid directly to the Property Manager. If your move occurs prior to the allotment start date, then you will need to pay the pro-rated rent directly to the Property Manager. The Tenant Lease Agreement spells out all relevant rent payment terms and conditions.</p>
                <h3>Gas and Electric Utilities</h3>
                <p>At this location, homes have an electric meter and are currently under live utility billing. Units are grouped together based on their size and construction and a seasonally adjusted electrical utility allowance is established. A few units have gas appliances and the cost is paid by the Property Management Office. For more information about your utilities contact the Property Management Office.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle.
                    <br><br>Before purchasing your insurance, please consult the Property Management Office for more information about coverage.

                <h3>Base Specific Policy</h3>
                <p>During your orientation, the Airman Dorm Leader (ADL) or UH Management Office representative will inform you of all Air Force and base-specific policies. Please contact your ADL within the first 2 duty days after your arrival to schedule your in-processing appointment.</p>
                <h3>UH Management Office Staff</h3>
                <p>The UH Management Office is staffed with professionals that can assist with all of your housing needs. Staffs vary but can be comprised of non-commissioned officers (NCO), Senior NCOs and some bases have civilian employees. The assigned military are Airman Dormitory Leaders. These members are highly motivated personnel dedicated to ensuring that residents receive quality service. ADLs will provide you guidance and advice on UH life as well as mentor you on succeeding in the Air Force.</p>
                <h3>Assignment Procedures</h3>
                <p>As soon as you are notified of your assignment contact your gaining unit and request to be assigned a sponsor. Your sponsor will be another military member assigned to your unit and will assist with your move. The sponsor or gaining unit must then contact the UH Management Office to notify them of your impending arrival date and work to secure you a dormitory room.</p>
                <h3>Planning Your Move</h3>
                <p>Prior to travel, arrange to meet your sponsor or someone from your unit upon arrival at the gaining installation. If possible, send a copy of your PCS orders to your sponsor to provide to your ADL. This will make it easier for your sponsor to acquire a room for you and for the ADL to reserve you a room and load you in their system as an in-bound resident.
                    <br><br>If you arrive on a business day during normal duty hours, have your sponsor escort you to the UH Management Office. Your ADL will schedule an in-processing briefing appointment where they will take you through the process of checking your room, performing a move-in inspection and inventory of the allotted furnishings and supplies. If you arrive on the weekend or after normal duty hours, have your sponsor make arrangements to pick up your room key and linens from your ADL until you can meet with them at a later date.
                    </p>
                <h3>Resident Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>You will be expected to keep your room and any shared living space clean and tidy. Cleaning supplies and equipment can be provided to you at your request. You will also be accountable for your room and the furnishings provided. Residents may be held liable for any damages beyond normal fair wear and tear. See your ADL or UH Management Office representative if you have any questions about your resident responsibilities.</p>
                <h3>Inspection Program</h3>
                <p>The Installation Commander establishes a base-wide UH inspection program focused on health and safety. Squadron Commanders and unit First Sergeants implement the inspection program and visit rooms to ensure that all residents from their squadron comply with installation standards.</p>
                <h3>Bay Orderly Program</h3>
                <p>UH residents are expected to assist in the cleaning and upkeep of common areas and shared facilities of their "home." You will periodically be detailed to perform essential cleaning and minor maintenance around the UH campus.</p>
                <h3>Dormitory Councils</h3>
                <p>The Dormitory Council is the forum by which residents of an individual dormitory or group of dormitories address concerns about their living environment with a panel of their peers. The purpose of the council is to establish standards for all residents, present solutions for problem areas, establish positive recreational activities and identify facility and furnishing improvements. Participation at your location is a chance to be involved in shaping your living environment and provides an opportunity for personal growth and development in the areas of leadership and personal relationships. Ask your ADL or UH Management Office representative about how you can get involved.</p>
                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>It is mandatory for unaccompanied residents in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service to reside in UH. An E-4 residing in UH reaching 3 years of service may be authorized to move out of UH and into local community housing. Contact your ADL for procedures you must follow to clear your room. In certain circumstances, such as to make space available for more junior military members, you may be authorized to move out of UH before reaching E-4 with greater than 3 years of service. The most senior residents are released first. Your ADL or UH Management Office representative will advise residents when early release is necessary.</p>
                <h3>Space Available Rooms</h3>
                <p>When there is an excess of dormitory rooms, personnel in the ranks of E-4 with greater than 3 years of service and above may be eligible to reside in UH on a space available basis. Personnel must send requests to their First Sergeant who will submit it for review and approval with the 6th Mission Support Group Commander through his/her Superintendent.</p>
