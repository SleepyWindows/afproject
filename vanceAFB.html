                <h2 class="header">Privatized Housing</h2>
                <p id="getting-started-statement">At Vance AFB, military family housing is privatized. Hunt Companies owns the family housing and is responsible for maintaining, repairing, constructing and managing the community. In addition to your option to purchase and rent housing in the local community, you now may choose to live in privatized housing by signing a tenant lease agreement with Hunt Companies

                    <br><br>For comprehensive information about the privatized housing community at Vance AFB, visit the Vance Family Housing website. The website provides information you need to know about the homes and amenities available in the privatized housing community.</p>
                <h3>Applying for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving to Vance AFB. The government housing team will provide you the latest information about privatized housing and details about the application process. The MHO will also update you on any base specific policies regarding residing in privatized housing.</p>
                <h3>Community Amenities</h3>
                <p>Privatized housing is comparable to housing in the local community and provides a wide variety of amenities and support services.

                    <br><br>Community features such as a community center, playgrounds, tennis courts and a volleyball court are just some of the amenities you will find at Vance Family Housing.
                    
                    <br><br>As a resident of privatized housing, contact the Property Management Office to obtain more specific information on the services available at your location.
                    </p>
                <h3>Paying Rent for Privatized Housing</h3>
                <p>Similar to living in the local community, you will sign a tenant lease agreement, typically for a one-year term. Your lease includes a military clause and a lease termination clause. You pay your monthly rent by authorizing an allotment of your BAH that is paid directly to the Property Manager. If your move occurs prior to the allotment start date, then you will need to pay the pro-rated rent directly to the Property Manager. The Tenant Lease Agreement spells out all relevant rent payment terms and conditions.</p>
                <h3>Gas and Electric Utilities</h3>
                <p>At this location, homes in the community are metered and you will be billed directly for gas and electric. Hunt manages and collects your utility bill based on personal consumption. Since the homes are metered, you will retain a portion of the BAH to pay the utilities directly. The more energy you conserve, the more money you keep in your pocket! For more information about your utilities, please contact the Property Management Office.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You need to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle.

                    <br><br>Hunt provides each resident with a $20,000 renter's insurance policy that has a $250 deductible. We encourage you to obtain personal property insurance for your privatized home, and should choose the kind and amount that best fits your needs as the policy provided by Hunt would most likely not be sufficient to cover the loss of all of personal property if a tragedy was to happen.
                    
                    <br><br>Before purchasing your insurance, please consult the Property Management Office for more information about coverage.
                    </p>
                <h3>School Information</h3>
                <p>The Eisenhower Elementary School (K through 5th grade), which is part of the Enid Independent School District (ISD), is located within the privatized housing area. The base falls into the Emerson Junior High (6th grade through 8th grade) and the Enid High School. Enid ISD provides bus service to Emerson and Enid High for Vance AFB families.</p>
