                <h2 class="header">Community Housing</h2>
                <h3>Housing in the Local Community</h3>
                <p id="faq-information">The Military Housing Office (MHO) provides all DoD personnel with a personalized service to assist in locating suitable housing in your new host country. Moving to a new country can often be confusing and stressful; however, it can also be exciting. Living off base provides members and families the chance to experience a new culture and make friends with their host country neighbors. The MHO will assist you every step of the way to help you find your new home in the local community.</p>
                <h3>Housing Services</h3>
                <p>Contact the MHO as soon as you know you are moving. The government housing team will provide you the latest information on the local housing situation as well as local laws governing off-base housing. The MHO partners with landlords, realtors and property managers to make sure you receive the most current information about the local housing market.<br><br>The MHO monitors off-base rental listings to ensure that they are safe and adequate.<br><br>The MHO can assist you by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing translation services to establish appointments to view available units</li>
                    <li>Negotiating lease contracts</li>
                    <li>Assisting in establishing utility services</li>
                    <li>Providing furnishings support. See Furnishings Management for a list of the Duration of Tour Items available.</li>
                    <li>Housing office provides transportation during daily apartment showing tour and also the sponsor is assisting the member</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After you move into your home, the MHO is available for on-going assistance with translation services should you need to communicate with your landlord.</p>
                <h3>Rental Partnership Program</h3>
                <p>At Izmir, Turkey the MHO supports the Rental Partnership Program to help military members obtain adequate housing in the community. The MHO and local landlords enter into agreements to offer service members special rental benefits above what other tenants receive. Typical benefits include a waiver of security and utility deposits, no credit checks or application fees, no separate building maintenance fee; everything is included in the rent. Two air conditioners are installed. No transfer of the electric and water meter to tenant's name. Contact the MHO for more information about this program.</p>
                <h3>Community Housing Units</h3>
                <p>The MHO provides up-to-date listings of available economy units, translation services, and landlord/tenant mediation.<br><br>Approximately 120 rental units are scattered throughout 9 districts within a 20-mile radius of 425 ABS and NATO Garrison. One, two and three bedroom units are available. There are units with four bedrooms and higher but are more difficult to find. In community housing units, there is no separate dining room; the living room and the dining room are all in one and there are no walk-in closets. Many landlords do not allow pets, so ask before making any commitments.<br><br>Most economy units have built-in kitchens, but the Furnishings Management Office will provide a kitchen range, refrigerator when required. They also provide a washer/dryer and wardrobes.<br><br>For information about the housing allowances that financially support your move, see Referral and Relocation Assistance.</p>
                <h3>Personal Property Insurance</h3>
                <p>You may wish to obtain legal liability and personal property insurance for your possessions and should choose the options and amounts that best fit your needs and lifestyle.<br><br>Before purchasing your insurance, please consult the MHO for more information about coverage.</p>
                <h3>Realtor Services</h3>
                <p>The use of local realtor services is typically unnecessary and is not recommended unless a home for rent is only listed with a specific realtor. In OCONUS, if you choose to use realtor services, discuss fees up front, as some realtors charge a finder's fee and government reimbursement is rarely authorized. To request government reimbursement for realtor services in OCONUS, you must submit a request for authorization through the MHO before signing a lease or contract. In CONUS, fees for realtor services are not reimbursable.</p>
