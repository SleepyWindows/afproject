                <p>Housing Early Assistance Tool (HEAT) creates an easy on-line experience to connect you, the Service Member, with your future destination and offers an on-line venue to obtain housing assistance prior to a PCS transfer. HQ Air Force Housing has successfully implemented HEAT across the AF Enterprise so members can reach out to installations when preparing for transition. Installations are accessible through the HEAT tool across CONUS and most OCONUS installations. Members should use HEAT when preparing to transfer to their new assignment. Learn more at the HOMES.mil site.</p>

                <h2 class="header">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h3 class="FAQ-main">Where can I find an application for housing? </h3>
                <p>If you desire to reside in government-owned or privatized housing, please log into the Housing Early Assistance Tool (HEAT) website. This website can be accessed by logging on to the AF Housing Website at https://www.housing.af.mil or on the HOMES.mil website at https://www.homes.mil and click on the “HEAT” Logo after you select the installation of your choice on these sites. HEAT creates an easy on-line experience and will connect you with the Military Housing Office (MHO) prior to your PCS transfer. HEAT also allows you to agree to release your personal information, to include contact information, to the Privatization Project Owner (Privatized Partner) team at bases with privatized family housing so they can provide you information directly. Once you agree, the MHO will send the Privatized Military Housing Office (PMO) your information.<br><br>HEAT is available at all AF installations and the installations are prepared to assist you when you submit your housing request through HEAT. Use HEAT to reach out to the installation housing office of your choice or PCS destination to request housing information and to request the application for housing. The MHO will send you pertinent installation and community information based on your housing choice(s) to include community housing support, as well as, forward you the required documents (e.g., DD Form 1746, AF Form 4422) needed to complete the application for housing. Each installation MHO will provide you details on how to return required documents including a copy of your PCS orders, if available, for their action. The MHO will provide you with specific information for status of government-owned housing based on your projected arrival to the installation. Or, if you requested information about privatized housing, the PMO will reach out to you directly regarding privatized housing options.<br><br>You can continue to reach out to the MHO through HEAT, email or call them directly if you require additional information.</p><br>
                <h3 class="FAQ-main">What housing allowances am I eligible for?</h3>
                <p>Military members are entitled to various allowances to ensure the transition to a new location is as smooth and stress free as possible. For information about your allowances, visit the Defense Travel Management Office website. If you have any questions, contact the local Military Housing Office.</p><br>
                <h3 class="FAQ-main">Where will my children go to school at my new location?</h3>
                <p>For families, we understand that where your children attend school plays a large factor in the decision of where to live.  For specific information about schools at your new location, contact the local Military Housing Office and they will be able to provide additional resources.</p><br>
                <h3 class="FAQ-main">How do I begin out-processing from housing?</h3>
                <p>Members should give at least 40 days advance notice of intent to terminate government-controlled family housing upon PCS, separation or retirement. However, if this is a short notice assignment, please contact the Military Housing Office (MHO) immediately so they can schedule your termination inspections. You will be scheduled for a pre-termination and final inspection of your home. The pre-termination inspection is to provide you with important information to help you in meeting final inspection requirements. If you have a copy of your orders, please provide a copy to the MHO. They will also assist you with submitting an advance housing application to your gaining installation if you are planning on living on base at your next location.<br><br>For information about out-processing from privatized housing, contact the local Property Management Office.</p><br>
                <h3 class="FAQ-main">What should I do to start planning my move to an overseas location?</h3>
                <p>Moving to an overseas location requires additional planning to make sure you and your family are prepared for the transition. There are many things you can do before you arrive to ensure the process to get settled in your new home and community is seamless.<br><br>For a list of specific items to consider prior to your move, see the Referral and Relocation Assistance section on each overseas base page. The local Airman and Family Readiness Center is another great resource to obtain pertinent information about the area. If you have any questions or require additional support, please contact the local Military Housing Office for more information about preparing for your move.</p><br>
                <h3 class="FAQ-main">Do I have to live in the dorms if I'm a permanent party unaccompanied Airman?</h3>
                <p>Most junior enlisted unaccompanied Airmen live in the dormitory. It is mandatory for Priority 1 (key and essential personnel) and Priority 2 (E-1 to E-3 and E-4 less than 3 years service) unaccompanied personnel to live in the dormitory. Other unaccompanied personnel may live in the dormitory on a space-available basis. Generally, an E-4 living in the dormitory who reaches 3 years of service may voluntarily occupy a room on a space-available basis without Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) or move into local community housing with BAH. In certain circumstances, such as to make space available for more junior personnel, you may be authorized to move out before reaching E-4 with greater than 3 years of service. The most senior Airmen are released first. Your Airmen Dorm Leader or UH Management Office representative will advise residents when early release is necessary.</p><br>
                <h3 class="FAQ-main">Will I get my own bedroom and bathroom if I live in Unaccompanied Housing?</h3>
                <p>The Air Force assignment standard is one private room for each permanent party. The new Air Force construction standard provides a private bath for each bedroom and a shared kitchen and common area, similar what you may find in the local community. Not every installation has the newest style dorms, however, so you may be in a dormitory that shares a bathroom with another Airman. You will still have a private room.</p><br>
                <h3 class="FAQ-main">I'm moving into Unaccompanied Housing and have a lot of household goods. What
                    should I ship and what should I put into storage?</h3>
                <p>Unaccompanied Housing (UH) is provided for unaccompanied Airmen in the ranks of E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service. Within each private sleeping room, Airmen are provided furnishings and supplies required for comfortable living. Room arrangements and the furnishings provided vary from base to base. Before shipping any personal items please contact the UH Management Office at your gaining installation for location specific information.<br><br>Once you know what furnishings you will be provided at your gaining installation, you should only bring supplemental items that can comfortably fit in your private sleeping room with the government issued furniture. Personnel with extensive household goods may submit a commander-endorsed request to the UH Management Office to reside in community housing and receive a Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) when the annual cost of moving and storage would exceed 50 percent of authorized BAH. (Moving cost + 12 months storage) / by 12 months > (monthly BAH rate) / 2) For more information, contact the UH Management Office.</p><br>
                <h3 class="FAQ-main">Can my significant other or guests stay with me in my dorm room?</h3>
                <p>The Installation Commander establishes local policy regarding social visits, so check with your UH Management Office for the local policy. At a minimum, guests must be at least 18 years old, be escorted at all times and are prohibited between hours 2400 - 0600 hours. Cohabitation is not authorized.</p><br>
                <h3 class="FAQ-main">What is housing privatization and how does it affect me?</h3>
                <p>Housing Privatization (HP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) initiative to continue providing quality housing for Airmen and their families. HP shifts the operations and maintenance responsibility of family housing in the continental U.S. and Alaska to the private sector whose expertise it is to build and manage housing, allowing Airmen to focus on the mission.<br><br>With this partnership, the Air Force and its private partners can provide new and/or renovated homes with modern amenities for Airmen and their families in communities where they choose to live. Rent under privatized housing is paid by allotment of your Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). Unlike housing in the local community, rent for a privatized home may not exceed the "with dependent" BAH rate designated for your rank.<br><br>For more information about privatized housing, contact the local Military Housing Office.</p><br>
                <h3 class="FAQ-main">How do I pay rent in privatized housing?</h3>
                <p>Similar to living in the local community, you will sign a tenant lease agreement, typically for a one-year term. Your lease includes a military clause and a lease termination clause. You pay your monthly rent by authorizing an allotment of your BAH that is paid directly to the Property Manager. If your move occurs prior to the allotment start date, then you will need to pay the pro-rated rent directly to the Property Manager.

                <p>The Air Force is working to privatize military family housing at all continental U.S. and Alaskan bases and the potential exists for this to occur during your tenure in government housing at one of these locations.<br><br>Housing Privatization (HP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) initiative to continue providing quality housing for Airmen and their families. HP shifts the operations and maintenance responsibility of family housing to the private sector whose expertise it is to build and manage housing, allowing Airmen to focus on the mission.<br><br>With this partnership, the Air Force and its private partners can provide new and/or renovated homes with modern amenities for Airmen and their families in communities where they choose to live. Some amenities may include community centers, playgrounds and walking trails.<br><br>All residents in government housing will have the option of signing a lease with the private company.

                <h3 class="FAQ-main">Does rent in privatized housing include utilities?</h3>
                <p>Utility payments at privatized continental U.S. and Alaskan bases may vary depending on whether your house is metered or not.</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the homes are metered, you will retain a portion of your BAH to pay the utilities directly</li>
                    <li>If the homes are not metered, your rent will include these utility costs, up to your full BAH amount</li>
                    <li>Depending on your location, you may be billed by your utility company or by the community itself</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>For specific information about utilities at your new location, see the Privatized Housing section on the base page or contact the local Property Management Office.</p><br>
                <h3 class="FAQ-main">Who is eligible to live in privatized housing?</h3>
                <p>Active-duty military personnel and their families authorized to reside on the installation are target tenants for privatized housing. However, as part of the privatization initiative, if the occupancy falls below expected levels, housing will open up to a priority placement list of Other Eligible Tenants (OET).<br><br>At all privatized locations if occupancy falls below the specified thresholds, policy allows other active duty military, Guard/Reserve military and families, federal civil service employees, retired military and federal civil service, DoD contractors and the general public to apply for and live in privatized housing. OETs ensure the housing privatization project stays financially viable and is a crucial element of sustainability for each housing community. For specific eligibility criteria, contact the Property Management Office.</p><br>
